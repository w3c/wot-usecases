# Basic Flow of Use Case Submission

## How to submit use cases

Please submit your use cases to using a GitHub issue with the provided Use Case template.
  - A Pull Request is preferred if you are a member of the WoT IG or WG. For external collaborators, issues are the only way to submit Use Cases.
2. Make sure to use <https://w3c.github.io/wot-usecases/#definitions> when formulating your use case.

## After approval by the Use Cases TF

1. Use cases that have been reviewed and approved for inclusion in [the IG note](https://w3c.github.io/wot-usecases/) are moved to https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/tree/master/USE-CASES/processed for archival purposes.
