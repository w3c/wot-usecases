# Basic Flow of Use Case Submission

This directory contains the use cases for the next revisions of the WoT specifications.

## How to submit use cases

1. Please describe new **use cases** useing the [Markdown template](use-case-template.md) [HTML template](use-case-template.html). (The HTML template is preferred.)
2. Please submit your use cases to [this directory](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/tree/main/USE-CASES) using [Pull Request](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/pulls).

## After approval by the Use Cases TF

1. Use cases that have been reviewed and approved for inclusion in [the IG note](https://w3c.github.io/wot-usecases/) are moved to https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/tree/master/USE-CASES/processed for archival purposes.


# Terminology

We use common terminology across the use cases to make sure 
everybody has the same understanding and the descriptions match
when we combine the use case in a single document.

Please avoid domain specific terminology, e.g. don't use MNO, telco. Better use network operator instead.

## Stakeholders and actors

- device owners  
- device user  
- cloud provider  
- service provider  
- device manufacturer   
- gateway manufacturer  
- network operator (potentially transparent for WoT use cases)  
- identity provider  
- directory service operator?
