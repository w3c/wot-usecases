## Terminology

We use common terminology across the use cases to make sure 
everybody has the same understanding and the descriptions will match
when we combine the use cases into a single document.

Please avoid domain-specific terminology, e.g., don't use "MNO" or "telco"; better to use "network operator" or "telephone company" instead.
