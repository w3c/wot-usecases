  <section id="abstract">
    <p>
      The Web of Things is applicable to multiple IoT domains,
      including Smart Home, Industrial, Smart City, Retail, and Health
      applications, where usage of the W3C WoT standards can simplify the
      development of IoT systems that combine devices from multiple vendors
      and ecosystems.
      During the last charter period of the WoT Working Group several
      specifications were developed to address requirements for
      these domains.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Use Case and Requirements Document is created
      to collect new IoT use cases from various domains
      that have been contributed by various stakeholders.
      These serve as a baseline for identifying requirements
      for the standardisation work in the W3C WoT groups.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has published the Web of Things
      (WoT) Architecture and Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description (TD) as
      official W3C Recommendations in May 2020. These specifications enable
      easy integration across Internet of Things platforms and applications.
    </p>
    <p>The W3C Web of Thing Architecture [[wot-architecture]] defines an
      abstract architecture, the WoT Thing Description [[wot-thing-description]]
      defines a format to describes a broad spectrum of very different devices,
      which may be connected over various protocols.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the inception phase of the WoT 1.0 specifications in 2017-2018
      the WoT IG collected use cases and requirements to enable
      interoperability of Internet of Things (IoT)
      services on a worldwide basis.
      Thes released specifications have been created to address the
      use cases and requirements for the first version of the WoT specifications,
      which are documented in <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot/ucr-doc/">
        https://w3c.github.io/wot/ucr-doc/</a>

    <p>
      The present document gathers and describes new use cases and requirements
      for future standardisation work in the WoT standard.
    </p>


    <section id="document-status" class="ednote" Disclaimer:>
      <p> This document is an early work in progress and is currently under significant editorial and content rework.
        It is currently an aggregation of use case descriptions that were contributed in a different
        file format (Markdown)</p>
      <p>Before it can be published as a IG note,
        it will undergo major restructuring and cleanup in due course.

        <dd>

          Integrating and interconnecting multiple devices into the common retail workflow
          (i.e., transaction log) drastically improves retail business operations at multiple levels.
          It brings operational visibility,including consumer behavior and environmental information,
          that was not previously possible or viable in a meaningful way.

          It drastically speeds up the process of root cause analysis of operational issues and
          simplifies the work of retailers.

        <dt>Description</dt>
        <dd>

          Falling costs of sensors, communications, and handling of very large volumes of data combined with cloud
          computing enable retail business operations with increased operational efficiency, better customer
          service,
          and even increased revenue growth and return on investment.

          Accurate forecasts allow retailers to coordinate demand-driven outcomes that deliver connected customer
          interactions.
          They drive optimal strategies in planning, increasing inventory productivity in retail supply chains,
          decreasing operational costs and driving customer satisfaction from engagement, to sale, to fulfilment.

          Understanding of store activity juxtaposed with traditional information streams can boost worker and
          consumer safety,
          comply better with work safety regulations, enhance system and site security, and improve worker
          efficiency
          by providing real-time visibility into worker status, location, and work environment.

          As a general rule, personal consumer information should not be stored.
          That is especially true in the retail industry where a security breach could cause financial, reputation,
          and brand damage.
          If personal or information that can identify a consumer is to be stored,
          it should be to conduct business and with the explicit acknowledgment of the consumer.
          WoT vendors and integrators should always have a privacy policy and make it easily available.
          By default, devices should adopt an opt-out policy.
          That means, unless the consumer explicitly allowed for the data capture and storage, avoid doing it.

            A lot of home devices, such as TV, cleaner, and home lighting, connect to an IP network.
            When you watch a content program, these devices should coorperate for enhancing your expereence.

            If the cleaning robot makes a loud noise while watching the TV program, it will hinder viewing.
            Also, even if you set up the theater environment with smart lights, it is troublesome to operate it
            yourself each time the TV program switches.

            Greenhouse Horticulture controlled by computers can create an optimal environment for growing plants. This
            enables to improve productivity and ensure stable vegetable production throughout the year, independent of
            the weather. This is the result of research on the growth of plants in the 1980s. For example, in
            tomatoes, switching to hydroponics and optimizing the temperature, humidity and CO2 concentration required
            for photosynthesis resulted in a five times increase in yield. The growth conditions for other vegetables
            also have been investigated, and this control system is applied now.

            Sensors and some facilities like heater, CO2 generator, sheet controller are connected to the gateway via
            wired or wireless networks. The gateway is connected to the cloud via the Internet. All sensors and
            facilities can be accessed and controlled from the cloud.
            To maximize photosynthesis, the temperature, CO2 concentration, and humidity in the greenhouse are mainly
            controlled. When the sunlight comes in the morning and CO2 concentration inside decreases, the application
            turns on the CO2 generator to keep over 400 ppm, the same as the air outside. The temperature in the
            greenhouse is adjusted by controlling the heater and the sunlight shielding sheet.
            The cloud gathers all sensor data and the status of the facilities. The application makes the best
            configuration for the region of the greenhouse located.

            Water is vital for ensuring food security to the world’s population, and agriculture is the biggest consumer
            amounting for 70% of freshwater. Field irrigation application methods are one of the main causes of water
            wastage. The most common technique, surface irrigation, wastes a high percentage of the water by wetting
            areas where no plants benefit from it. On the other hand, localized irrigation can use water more
            efficiently and effectively, avoiding both under-irrigation and over-irrigation. However, in an attempt to
            avoid under-irrigation, farmers feed more water than is needed resulting not only to productivity losses,
            but also water wastages.

            Therefore, technology should be developed and deployed for sensing water needs and automatically manage
            water supply to crops. However, open field agriculture is characterized by a quite dynamic range of
            requirements. Usually, solutions developed for one particular crop type cannot be reused in other
            cultivations. Moreover, the same field can have different crop types or different sizes/shapes during the
            years, meaning that technology to monitor the state of crop growth should be highly configurable and
            adaptive. Even agriculture and irrigation methods can change and also they are very different depending on
            the size of the field and its clime type.

            Consequently, silos applications are deployed leveraging on IoT technologies to gather data about the crop
            growth state and irrigation needs. The Web of Things may help to create a single platform where
            cost-effective applications could adapt seamlessly between different scenarios, breaking the silos and
            giving value both to the environment and the market.

            Sensor data plays a central role in Smart Agriculture. In particular, it is critical that the information
            sensed is associated with a timestamp. Common algorithms use *time series* to calculate the water needs of a
            crop.

            Furthermore, soil sensors usually are calibrated over a specific soil type (which may differ even in the
            same geographic region). For example, the calibration data for a soil moisture sensor is represented by a
            function that maps sensor output to soil water content. In literature, this function is knowns as a
            *calibration curve*. Commercial sensors are precalibrated with a "standard" curve but on most occasions, it
            fails to accurately measure the water content. Therefore, it can be configured during the installation phase
            (which may happen every time the soil is plowed).

            Finally, a crucial aspect is forecasting. Farmers use this information to actively change their management
            procedures. Services exploit it to suggest irrigation schedule or change device settings to behave
            accordingly to environmental changes.

            To summarize here it is a list of most important expected data from Open field agriculture:

            <ul>
              <li>Calibration curve</li>
              <li>Time series</li>
              <li>Forecast data</li>
              <li>Geolocations: sensor data must be contextualized in geolocation. Also, geolocation is critical in
                massive open fields to localize instrument position.</li>
              <li>Weather data</li>
              <li>Unit of measure: commercial soli sensor may output their value in a different unit of measures (i.e.
                volts or % water in an m^3 of soil)</li>
              <li>Relative values</li>
              <li>Depth position: geolocation is not sufficient to describe the parameters of the soil. Depth is an
                additional context that should be added to an observed value. </li>

            In open-field agriculture, the IoT solutions leverage on different radio protocols and devices. Usually,
            radio protocols should cover long distances (even kilometers) and be energy efficient. Devices too need to
            be energy saving as they are deployed for months and sometimes even years in harsh environments. A
            sleeping-cycle is one mechanism they use to save energy usually coordinated by *loggers/gateways* or
            preprogrammed. *Loggers* are deployed closed to sensor devices and have more storage space. They serve as
            buffers between sensors and higher services. Often *loggers* and sensors are embedded in the same board,
            otherwise, they are connected using cables or close-ranged radio protocols. On the other hand, *gateways*
            serve as a collection point for data of an entire field or farm. They are much more capable devices and
            usually are more energy-consuming. In some deployment scenarios, they host a full operating system with
            multiple software facilities installed. Otherwise, gateways only serve as relays of data sent from the
            loggers and sensors to cloud services and vice-versa. The cloud services may be partially hosted in edge
            servers to preserve data privacy and responsiveness of the whole IoT solution. Possible cloud services are:
            <ul>
              <li>Weather forecasting/local weather forecasting</li>
              <li>Soil digital twin to simulate and predict water content</li>
              <li>Plant digital twin (growth and water needs prediction)</li>
              <li>Irrigation advice service: combining the previous services and knowing the irrigation system topology
                is possible to advise farms with the best times to irrigate a crop. </li>
              <li>Pesticide and fertilize planning</li>

          <dd>

            Depending on the type of crops (e.g. maize), cultivated plots may need specific irrigation processes
            in outdoor environments. Depending on the country there exist some specific pedo-climatic conditions
            and some water consumption restrictions. Thus an irrigation system is installed on the plot. It is used
            on a several days basis (e.g. every 7 days), for each plot. The goal is to optimize the irrigation decision
            based on the crop development stage and the quantity of rain that has already fallen down on the plot.
            For example an important rain may postpone the irrigation decision.
            <br>
            <br>
            This use case aims to evaluate the number of days to delay the irrigation system, in addition to the basis
            irrigation frequency (e.g. 2 delay days means 9 days between two irrigations).

            To decide when to water a cultivated plot, we evaluate the crop growth stage, the root zone moisture level
            and the number of delay days:

            <ul>
              <li>To evaluate the <b>Crop growth stage</b>, we need:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Min and max temperature per day: the <b>min temperature per day</b> is evaluated on the period [d-1
                  18:00, d 18:00[. The <b>*max temperature per day</b> is evaluated on the period [d 06:00:00, d+1
                  06:00:00[.i</li>
                <li><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growing_degree-day">Growing degree day</a></b> values uses
                  min and max temperature per day, the sowing day and the type of seed. The Growing degree day is
                  compared to some thresholds to evaluate the crop growth stage</li>
              </ul>
              <li>To evaluate the <b>Root zone moisture level</b>, we need: </li>
              <ul>
                <li>Mean moisture per day per probe: in order to get reliable values, each tensiometer sends several
                  measurements of soil moisture, at fixed hours of the day (usually in the morning), that are
                  aggregated; their mean value is considered</li>
                <li>For the set of 3 tensiometers localised at the same level of depth, the median value is evaluated
                  from their mean per day moisture measurements. One tensiometer may not provide accurate values (the
                  soil around the probe is too dry and the soil matter is not connected to the probe). The median value
                  of three different tensiometers at the same depth will improve the accuracy of the moisture
                  measurement.</li>
                <li>Then the sum of the two median values at two different depths is evaluated, to take into account the
                  quantity of water available in the root zone volume. This aggregated value estimates the root zone
                  moisture level. </li>
                <li>The root zone moisture level is compared to some thresholds (dependent on the crop growth stage) to
                  evaluate if the crop needs water or not at the end of the basis irrigation period.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>To determine the <b>number of delay days</b>, we need:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>The time period between two waterings of the same plot is dependent on the farm and known by the
                  farmer. When a watering is launched, no new watering should be planned during the basic irrigation
                  frequency. The quantity of rain that falls down on the plot may postpone the watering plan. The total
                  quantity of rain per day is compared to some thresholds to determine the number of delay days.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>

            The mobile pluviometer is used to validate that the quantity of water received by the crop actually
            corresponds to the quantity of water provided by the watering system.
            <br>
            <br>
            At the end, the farmer may decide if he follows the irrigation recommendations or not. He could force the
            watering for one of the next days.

          <dt>Gaps</dt>
          <dd>

            The main potential issues come from tensiometers located in the plot, as they are known to be cheap and easy
            to use probes but not always reliable. They can face multiple issues: if the soil gets too dry or the probe
            is improperly installed, there may be air between the probe and the soil, therefore preventing the probe
            from providing accurate conductivity measurements.
            <br>
            <br>
            To be sure of the quality of those measurements each tensiometer sends its measurements several times (3 to
            5) per day. The tensiometer may send an inappropriate value due to the bad connexion between the soil and
            the probe, that is the reason why three tensiometers are used and the median value is computed. If the
            gateway does not receive the value of one sensor during a whole day, an alert should be sent. To take an
            irrigation decision, at least one measurement per sensor and per day should be provided.
            <br>
            <br>
            The gateway can create a virtual entity corresponding to the sensor and allow the application to access this
            virtual entity having the actual sensor status like sleeping.
            <br>
            <br>
            Sensor nodes deployed in outdoor environments may take into account that their energy supply device
            (battery, solar panel) constrains the lifetime of the device. Thus they should be able to alert that they
            may not be able to provide a service due to lack of energy or they should be able to change their
            configuration and switch communication protocols to save as much energy as possible.
            <br>
            <br>
            Moreover wireless communication can be impacted by weather conditions or any outdoor conditions. For example
            a tractor that comes too close to the sensor node may move the communication device and destroy some
            components. Some kind of network supervision must be achieved (for instance by the gateway) to check node
            availability.

            This use case has been implemented in France, following local conditions and regulations. There exists an
            open manual irrigation decision method called <a
              href="http://www.irrinov.arvalisinstitutduvegetal.fr/irrinov.asp">IRRINOV®</a> developed by Arvalis [2]
            and INRAE dedicated to France and some specific crops: maize, wheat and cereals, potatoes and beans.
            <br>
            <br>
            IRRINOV® can be automated using wireless sensor networks and semantic web technologies. The considered
            network is of star type: all sensors can communicate with a common gateway, which is connected to the
            Internet. The IRRINOV® implementation was developed in [3]. This work presents an expert system for maize
            using drools. It automates the irrigation decision for maize based on sensor measurements.
            <br>
            <br>
            To measure weather properties, we use the recommendation provided by the French National Weather Institute:
            Météo France[4]. Its web site defines how to evaluate the min and max temperatures per day in <a

            Water is vital for ensuring food security to the world’s population, and agriculture is the biggest consumer
            amounting for 70% of freshwater. Field irrigation application methods are one of the main causes of water
            wastage. The most common technique, surface irrigation, wastes a high percentage of the water by wetting
            areas where no plants benefit from it. On the other hand, localized irrigation can use water more
            efficiently and effectively, avoiding both under-irrigation and over-irrigation. However, in an attempt to
            avoid under-irrigation, farmers feed more water than is needed resulting not only to productivity losses,
            but also water wastages.

            Therefore, technology should be developed and deployed for sensing water needs and automatically manage
            water supply to crops. However, open field agriculture is characterized by a quite dynamic range of
            requirements. Usually, solutions developed for one particular crop type cannot be reused in other
            cultivations. Moreover, the same field can have different crop types or different sizes/shapes during the
            years, meaning that technology to monitor the state of crop growth should be highly configurable and
            adaptive. Even agriculture and irrigation methods can change and also they are very different depending on
            the size of the field and its clime type.

            Consequently, silos applications are deployed leveraging on IoT technologies to gather data about the crop
            growth state and irrigation needs. The Web of Things may help to create a single platform where
            cost-effective applications could adapt seamlessly between different scenarios, breaking the silos and
            giving value both to the environment and the market.

            Sensor data plays a central role in Smart Agriculture. In particular, it is critical that the information
            sensed is associated with a timestamp. Common algorithms use *time series* to calculate the water needs of a
            crop.

            Furthermore, soil sensors usually are calibrated over a specific soil type (which may differ even in the
            same geographic region). For example, the calibration data for a soil moisture sensor is represented by a
            function that maps sensor output to soil water content. In literature, this function is knowns as a
            *calibration curve*. Commercial sensors are precalibrated with a "standard" curve but on most occasions, it
            fails to accurately measure the water content. Therefore, it can be configured during the installation phase
            (which may happen every time the soil is plowed).

            Finally, a crucial aspect is forecasting. Farmers use this information to actively change their management
            procedures. Services exploit it to suggest irrigation schedule or change device settings to behave
            accordingly to environmental changes.

            To summarize here it is a list of most important expected data from Open field agriculture:

            <ul>
              <li>Calibration curve</li>
              <li>Time series</li>
              <li>Forecast data</li>
              <li>Geolocations: sensor data must be contextualized in geolocation. Also, geolocation is critical in
                massive open fields to localize instrument position.</li>
              <li>Weather data</li>
              <li>Unit of measure: commercial soli sensor may output their value in a different unit of measures (i.e.
                volts or % water in an m^3 of soil)</li>
              <li>Relative values</li>
              <li>Depth position: geolocation is not sufficient to describe the parameters of the soil. Depth is an
                additional context that should be added to an observed value. </li>

            In open-field agriculture, the IoT solutions leverage on different radio protocols and devices. Usually,
            radio protocols should cover long distances (even kilometers) and be energy efficient. Devices too need to
            be energy saving as they are deployed for months and sometimes even years in harsh environments. A
            sleeping-cycle is one mechanism they use to save energy usually coordinated by *loggers/gateways* or
            preprogrammed. *Loggers* are deployed closed to sensor devices and have more storage space. They serve as
            buffers between sensors and higher services. Often *loggers* and sensors are embedded in the same board,
            otherwise, they are connected using cables or close-ranged radio protocols. On the other hand, *gateways*
            serve as a collection point for data of an entire field or farm. They are much more capable devices and
            usually are more energy-consuming. In some deployment scenarios, they host a full operating system with
            multiple software facilities installed. Otherwise, gateways only serve as relays of data sent from the
            loggers and sensors to cloud services and vice-versa. The cloud services may be partially hosted in edge
            servers to preserve data privacy and responsiveness of the whole IoT solution. Possible cloud services are:
            <ul>
              <li>Weather forecasting/local weather forecasting</li>
              <li>Soil digital twin to simulate and predict water content</li>
              <li>Plant digital twin (growth and water needs prediction)</li>
              <li>Irrigation advice service: combining the previous services and knowing the irrigation system topology
                is possible to advise farms with the best times to irrigate a crop. </li>
              <li>Pesticide and fertilize planning</li>
            </ul>

            Currently, there is no specification on how to model device status (i.e. connected/disconnected)
            Examples of how to handle a device calibration phase may help developers to use a standardized approach.

            Please follow the <a href="http://swamp-project.org/">link</a> for further information. Since SWAMP is
            heavily oriented to optimize water consumption, this document just mentioned issues like plant feeding,

            Smart Cities need to track a large number of mobile devices and sensors.
            Location information may be integrated with a logistics or fleet management
            system.
            A reusable geolocation module is needed with a common network interface to
            include in these various applications.
            For outdoor applications, GPS
            could be used, but indoors other geolocation technologies might be
            used, such as WiFi triangulation or vision-based navigation (SLAM).
            Therefore the geolocation information should be technology-agnostic.

            Note: the system should be capable of notifying consumers
            of changes in location.
            This may be used to implement geofencing by some other system.
            This may require additional parameters, such as the
            maximum distance that the device may be moved before a notification is
            sent, or the maximum amount of time between updates.
            Notifications may be sent by a variety of means, some of which may
            not be traditional push mechanisms (for example, email might be used).
            For geofencing applications, it is not necessary that the device be aware
            of the fence boundaries; these can be managed by a separate system.

            Smart Cities have the need to observe the physical locations of
            large number of mobile devices
            in use in the context of a Fleet or Logistics Management System, or
            to place sensor data on a map in a Dashboard application.
            These systems may also include geofencing notifications and mapping
            (visual tracking) capabilities.

            High-resolution timestamps can be used in conjunction with cache manipulation to
            access protected regions of memory, as with the SPECTRE exploit. Certain
            geolocation APIs and technologies can return high-resolution timestamps which
            can be a potential problem. Eventually these issues will be addressed in cache
            architecture but in the meantime a workaround is to artificially limit the
            resolution of timestamps.

          <dt>Privacy Considerations</dt><dd>
            <p>
            Location is generally considered private information when it is used with a device
            that may be associated with a specific person, such as a phone or vehicle, as it
            can be used to track that person and infer their activities or who they associate
            with (if multiple people are being tracked at once). Therefore APIs to access geographic location
            in sensitive contexts are often restricted, and access is allowed only after confirming
            permission from the user.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Gaps</dt><dd>
            <p>
            There is no single standardized semantic vocabulary for representing location data.
            Location data can be point data, a path, an area or a volumetric object.
            Location information can be expressed using multiple standards,
            but the reader of location data in a TD or in data returned by an IoT device
            must be able to unambiguously describe location information.
            </p><p>
            There are both dynamic (data returned by a mobile sensor) and static (fixed installation
            location) applications for geolocation data. For dynamic location data, some recommended vocabulary
            to annotate data schemas would be useful. For static location data, a standard format
            for metadata to be included in a TD itself would be useful.

          <p>
          In order to facilitate Smart City planning and decision-making, a Smart City 
          dashboard interface makes it possible for city management to 
          view and visualize all sensor data through the entire city in real time,
          with data identified as to geographic source location.  
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Expected Devices</dt><dd>
          <p>
          Actuators can include robots; for these, commands might be given to robots to move to new locations,
          drop off or pick up sensor packages, etc.
          However, it could also include other kinds of actuators, such as flood gates, traffic signals, lights, signs, etc.
          For example, posting a public message on an electronic billboard might be one task possible through the
          dashboard.
          </p><p>
          Sensors can include those for the environment and for people and traffic management 
          (density counts, thermal cameras, car speeds, etc).
          status of robots, other actuators, and sensors, data visualization,
          and (optionally) historical comparisons.
          </p><p>
          Dashboard would include mapping functionality. 
          Mapping implies a need for location data for every actuator and sensor, which could be
          acquired through geolocation sensors (e.g. GPS) or assigned statically during installation.
          </p><p>
          This use case also includes images from cameras and real-time image and data streaming.

            Public spaces provide many opportunities for engaging, social and fun interaction.
            At the same time,
            preserving privacy while sharing tasks and activities with other people is a major issue
            in ambient systems.
            These systems may also deliver personalized information in combination
            with more general services presented publicly.

            A trustful discovery of the services and devices available in such environments
            is a necessity to guarantee personalization and privacy in public-space applications.

            Interactive installations such as touch-sensitive or gesture-tracking billboards
            may be set up in public places.
            Objects that present public information (e.g. a map of a shopping mall)
            can use a multimodal interface (built-in or in tandem with the user's mobile devices)
            to simplify user interaction and provide faster access.
            Other setups can stimulate social activities,
            allowing multiple people to enter an interaction simultaneously to work together
            towards a certain goal (for a prize)
            or just for fun (e.g. play a musical instrument or control a lighting exhibition).
            In a context where privacy is an issue
            (for example, with targeted/personalized alerts or advertisements),
            the user's mobile device acts as a mediator for the services
            running on the public network.
            This allows the user to receive relevant information in the way she sees fit.
            Notifications can serve as triggers for interaction with public devices and services
            if the user chooses to do so.

            A conference room where a series of meetings will take place.
            People can go in and out of the room before,
            after and during the meeting.
            The door is "touched" by a badge.
            An application on the user's mobile device can
            activate any available display in the room and the room and can access and
            receive notification from devices and services in the room.
            The chair of the meeting is notified by a dynamically composed graphic animation,
            audio notification or a mobile phone notification,
            about available devices and services, and
            can install applications indicated by links.

            The chair of the meeting selects a setup procedure by text amongst the provided links.
            These options could be, for example:
            photo step-by-step instructions (smartphone, HDTV display, Web site),
            audio instructions (MP3 audio guide, room speakers reproduction, HDTV audio)
            or RFID enhanced instructions (mobile SmartTag Reader, RFID Reader for smartphone).
            The chair of the meeting chooses the room speakers reproduction,
            then the guiding Service is activated and he starts to set the video projector.
            After some attendees arrive,
            the chair of the meeting changes to the slide show option and continues to
            follow the instructions at the same step it was paused but with another more
            private modality for example, a smartphone slideshow.

            In this use case a network full of IoT devices is presented, in which these devices are registered in
            several Middle-Nodes. The challenge presented in this scenario is to been able do discover the different
            sensors, by issues a SPARQL query, and without having prior knowledge of where those devices are allocated.
            Therefore, the discovery SPARQL query must start from a specific Middle-Node and reach all those
            Middle-Nodes that are relevant to answer the query.

            This scenario requires that discovery does not only happen locally when a Middle-Node receives the query and
            checks if some Thing Description registered is suitable to answer the query. Instead, the scenario requires
            also that the Middle-Node forwards the query through the network (topology conformed by the middle-nodes) in
            order to find those Middle-Nodes that actually contain relevant Thing Descriptions. Notice from the
            following example that the query is not broadcasted in the network to prevent flooding, instead the
            Middle-Nodes follow some discovery heuristic to know where the query should be forwarded. Also, notice that
            in this scenario not all the Middle-Nodes have the IoT devices registered directly within, they are
            Middle-Nodes collectors, such as Middle-Node C, I, G, and D.

          <dt> Description</dt>
          <dd>
            A campus has a wide range of IoT devices distributed across their grounds. These IoT devices belong to very
            different domains in a smart city, such as, energy, buildings, environment, water, wearable, etc. The IoT
            devices are distributed across the campus and belong to different infrastructures or even to individuals. A
            sample topology of this scenario could be the following:

            <br>
            <br>

            <img src="images/smart-campus-topology.svg" width="100%" height="100%">

            <br>
            <br>

            In this scenario, energy-related IoT devices monitor the energy use and income in the campus, among other
            things. From these measurements, an Energy Management System may predict a negative peak of incoming energy
            that would entail the failure of the whole system. In this case, a Service or a User needs to discover all
            those IoT devices that are not critical for the normal functioning of the campus (such as indoor or outdoor
            illumination, HVAC systems, or water heaters) and interact with them in order to save energy, by switching
            them off or reducing their consumption. Besides, the same Service or User will look for those IoT devices
            that are critical for the well-functioning of the campus (such as magnetic locks, water distribution system,
            or fire/smoke sensors) and ensure that they are up and running. Additionally, the Service or the User, will
            discover relevant people's wearable to warn them about the situation.

            <p>Sample flow:</p> A service, or a user, sends a (SPARQL) query to the discovery endpoint of a known
            Middle-Node (which can be wrapped by a GUI). The Middle-Node will try to answer the query first checking the
            Thing Descriptions of the IoT devices registered in such Middle-Node. Then, if the query requires further
            discovery, or it was not successfully answered the Middle-Node will forward the query to its *known*
            Middle-Nodes. Recursively, the Middle-Nodes will try to answer the query and/or forward the query to their
            known Middle-Nodes. When one Middle-Node is able to answer the query it will forward back to the former
            Middle-Node the partial query answer. Finally, when the discovery task finishes, the former Middle-Node will
            join all the partial query answers producing an unified view (which could be synchronous or asynchronous).

            <br>
            <br>


            For instance, assuming Middle-Node F receives a query that asks about all the discoverable Building IoT
            devices in the campus. First, the Middle-Node F will try to answer the query with the Thing Descriptions of
            the IoT registered within. Since Middle-Node F contains some Building IoT devices a partial query answer is
            achieved. However, since they query asked about all the discoverable Building IoT devices Middle-Node F
            should forward the query to its other known Middle-Nodes, i.e., Middle-Node G. This process will be repeated
            by the Middle-Nodes until the query reaches the Middle-Nodes H and B which are the ones that have registered
            Thing Descriptions about IoT buildings. Therefore, the query will travel through the topology as follows:
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="images/smart-campus-sample.svg" width="100%" height="100%">
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally, when Middle Nodes B and H compute two partial query answers, those answers will be forwarded back
            to Middle-Node F which will join them with its former partial query answer obtained from its registered
            Thing Descriptions. Finally, a global query answer will be provided.

              A system to monitor the health of people in public places is useful to
              control the spread of infectious diseases. In particular, we would like
              to identify individuals with temperatures outside the norm (i.e. running
              a fever) and then take appropriate action. Actions can include sending
              a notification or actuating a security device, such as a gate.

              This mechanism should be non-invasive and non-contact since the solution
              should not itself contribute to the spread of infectious diseases.

              Data may also be aggregated for statistics purposes, for example, to
              identify the number of people in an area with elevated temperatures.
              This has additional requirements to avoid double-counting individuals.

            <dd>

              A thermal camera image is taken of a group of people
              and an AI service is used to identify faces in the image.
              The temperature of each person is then estimated from the registered face;
              for greater accuracy, a consistent location for sampling should be used, such
              as the forehead.
              The estimated temperature is compared to high (and optionally, low)
              thresholds and a notification (or other action) is taken if the
              temperature is outside the norm.
              Additional features may be extracted to identify unique individuals.

                <li>Enough information is included in the notification that the specific

                  camera is also registered with the thermal camera, then a bounding box may
                  be indicated via JSON and the RGB image included; or the bounding box could
                  be actually drawn into the sent image, or the face could be cropped out.
                  This is useful if, for example, a notification needs to be sent to health
                  or security workers who need to identify the person in a crowd.</li>

              Preventable medical errors may account for more than 100,000 deaths per year in U.S. alone. These errors
              are mainly caused by failures of communication such as a chart misread or the wrong data passed along to
              machines or staffs. Part of the problem could be solved if the machines could speak to one another.
              Manufacturers have little incentive to make their proprietary code and data easily to accessible and
              process able by their competitors’ machines. So the task of middleman falls to the hospital staffs. In
              addition to saving lives, a common framework could result in collecting and recording more clinical data
              on patients, making it easier to deliver precision medicine.

            <dd>

              Physiological Closed-Loop Control (PCLC) devices are a group of emerging technologies, which use
              feedback from physiological sensor(s) to autonomously manipulate physiological variable(s) through
              delivery of therapies conventionally delivered by clinician(s).

              Clinical scenario without PCLC. An elderly female with end-stage renal failure was given a standard
              insulin infusion protocol to manage her blood glucose, but no glucose was provided. Her blood glucose
              dropped to 33, then rebounded to over 200 after glucose was given. This scenario has not changed for
              decades.

              The desired state with PCLC implemented in an ICU. A patient is receiving an IV insulin infusion and is
              having the blood glucose continuously monitored. The infusion pump rate is automatically adjusted
              according to the real-time blood glucose levels being measured, to maintain blood glucose values in a
              target range. If the patient’s glucose level does not respond appropriately to the changes in insulin
              administration, the clinical staff is alerted.

              Medical devices do not interact with each other autonomously (monitors, ventilator, IV pumps, etc.)
              Contextually rich data is difficult to acquire. Technologies and standards to reduce medical errors and
              improve efficiency have not been implemented in theater or at home.

              In recent years, researchers have made progress developing PCLC devices for mechanical ventilation,
              anesthetic delivery applications, and so on. Despite these promises and potential benefits, there has
              been limited success in the translation of PCLC devices from <a
                href="https://today.duke.edu/2014/07/benchbedside">bench to bedside</a>. A key challenge to bringing
              PCLC devices to a level required for a clinical trials in humans is risk management to ensure device
              reliability and safety.

              The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies new hazards that might be introduced by
              PCLC devices into three categories. Besides clinical factors (e.g. sensor validity and reliability,
              inter- and intra-patient physiological variability) and usability/human factors (e.g. loss of
              situational awareness, errors, and lapses in operation), there are also engineering challenges including
              robustness, availability, and integration issues.

            <dt>Security Considerations</dt>
            <dd>

              Security considerations for interconnected and dynamically composable medical systems are critical not
              only because laws such as <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html">HIPAA</a> mandate it, but also
              because security attacks can have serious safety consequences for patients. The systems need to support
              automatic verification that the system components are being used as intended in the clinical context,
              that the components are authentic and authorized for use in that environment, that they have been
              approved by the hospital’s biomedical engineering staff and that they meet regulatory safety and
              effectiveness requirements.

              For security and safety reasons, <a href="https://www.astm.org/Standards/F2761.htm">ICE
                F2761-09(2013)</a> compliant medical devices never interact directly each other. All interaction is
              coordinated and controlled via the applications.

              While transport-level security such as TLS provides reasonable protection against external attackers,
              they do not provide mechanisms for granular access control for data streams happening within the same
              protected link. Transport-level security is also not sufficiently flexible to balance between security
              and performance. Another issue with widely used transport-level security solutions is the lack of
              support for multicast.

              In medical facilities,
              a system may provide multiple options to control sensor operations
              by voice or gesture ("start reading my blood pressure now").
              These interactions may be mediated by an application installed into a smartphone.
              The system integrates information from multiple sensors
              (for example, blood pressure and heart rate);
              reports medical sensor readings periodically (for example, to a remote medical facility)
              and sends alerts when unusual readings/events are detected.

            Production lines for industrial manufacturing consist of multiple machines, where each machine
            incorporates sensors for various values.
            A failure of a single machine can cause defective products or a stop of the entire production.

            Big data analysis enables to identify behavioral patterns across multiple production lines of the entire
            production plant and across multiple plants.

            The results of this analysis can be used for optimizing consumption of raw materials, checking the status
            of production lines and plants and predicting and preventing fault conditions.

            A company owns multiple factories which contain multiple production lines.
            Examples are production lines, environment sensors,
            These devices collect data from multiple sensors and transmit this information to the cloud. Sensor data
            is stored in the cloud, can be visualized and analyzed using machine learning / AI.

            The cloud service allows to manage single and groups of devices.
            Combining the data streams from multiple devices allows to get an easy overview of the state of all
            connected devices in the user's realm.

            In many cases there are groups of devices of the same kind, so the aggregation of data across devices can
            serve to identify anomalies or to predict impending outages.

            The cloud service allows to manage single and groups of devices and can help to identify abonormal
            conditions.
            For this purpose a set of rules can be defined by the user, which raises alerts towards the user or
            triggers actions on devices based on these rules.

            This enables the early detection of pending problems and reduces the risk of machine outages, quality
            problems or threats to the environment or life of humans.

            A digital twin is the virtual representation of a physical asset such as a machine, a vehicle, robot,
            sensor.
            Using a digital twin allows businesses to analyze their physical assets to troubleshoot in real time,
            predict future problems, minimize downtime, and perform simulations to create new business opportunities.

            A digital twin may also be called a twin or a shadow. Digital twin technology may be referred to as device
            virtualization.

            Digital twins can be located in the edge or in the cloud.

            <p>Virtual Twin</p>

            The virtual twin is a representation of a physical device or an asset. A virtual twin uses a model that
            contains observed and desired attribute values and also uses a semantic model of the behavior of the
            device.

            Intermittent connectivity: An application may not be able to connect to the physical asset. In such a
            scenario, the application must be able to retrieve the last known status and to control the operation
            states of other assets.

            Protocol abstraction: Typically, devices use a variety of protocols and methods to connect to the IoT
            network. From a users perspective this complexity should not affect other business applications such as an
            enterprise resource planning (ERP) application.

            Business rules: The user can specify the normal operating range of a property in a semantic model.
            Business rules can be declaratively defined and actions can be automatically invoked in the edge or on the
            device.

            Example: In a fleet of connected vehicles, the user monitors a collection of operating parameters, such as
            fuel level, location, speed and others. The semantics-based virtual twin model enables the user to decide
            whether the operating parameters are in normal range. In out of range conditions the user can take
            appropriate actions.


            <p>Predictive Twin</p>

            In a predictive twin, the digital twin implementation builds an analytical or statistical model for
            prediction by using a machine-learning technique. It need not involve the original designers of the
            machine. It is different from the physics-based models that are static, complex, do not adapt to a
            constantly changing environment, and can be created only by the original designers of the machine.

            A data analyst can easily create a model based on external observation of a machine and can develop
            multiple models based on the user’s needs.
            The model considers the entire business scenario and generates contextual data for analysis and
            prediction.

            When the model detects a future problem or a future state of a machine, the user can prevent or prepare
            for them.
            The user can use the predictive twin model to determine trends and patterns from the contextual machine
            data. The model helps to address business problems.


            <p>Twin Projections</p>

            In twin projections, the predictions and the insights integrate with back-end business applications,
            making IoT an integral part of business processes.
            When projections are integrated with a business process, they can trigger a remedial business workflow.

            Prediction data offers insights into the operations of machines. Projecting these insights into the
            back-end applications infrastructure enables business applications to interact with the IoT system and
            transform into intelligent systems.

            In smart city, home and industrial scenarios various devices are connected to a common network. These
            devices implement different protocols. To enable interoperability, an "agent" needs to communicate across
            different protocols. Platforms for this agent can be edge devices, gateways or cloud services.

            Interoperability across protocols is a must for all user scenarios that integrate devices from more than
            one protocol.

          </dd>
          <dt>Expected Devices</dt>
          <dd>

            Various sensors, e.g. temperature, light, humidity, vibration, noise, air quality, edge devices, gateways,
            cloud servers and services.

            There are multiple user scenarios that are addressed by this use case.

            An example in the smart home environment is an automatic control lamps, air conditioners, heating, window
            blinds in a household
            based on sensor data, e.g. sunlight, human presence, calendar and clock, etc.

            In an industrial environment individual actuators and production devices use different protocols.
            Examples include MQTT, OPC-UA, Modbus, Fieldbus, and others.
            Gathering data from these devices, e.g. to support digital twins or big data use cases requires an "Agent"
            to bridge across these protocols.
            To provide interoperability and to reduce implementation complexity of this agent a common set of (minimum
            and maximum)
            requirements need to be supported by all interoperating devices.

            A smart city environment is similar to the industrial scenario in terms of device interoperability.
            Devices differ however,
            they include smart traffic lights, traffic monitoring, people counters, cameras.

            Recognizer system development has arrived at a point of maturity where
            if we want to dramatically enhance recognition performance,
            sensor fusion from multiple modalities is needed.
            In order to achieve this,
            an image recognizer should incorporate results coming from other
            kinds of recognizers (e.g. audio recognizer) within the network
            engaged in the same interaction cycle.

            An audio recognizer has been trained with the more common sounds in the house,

            In the same house a security system uses a video recognizer to identify people
            at the front door.
            These two systems need to cooperate with a remote home management system

            One of the main indicators concerning the usability of a system
            is the corresponding level of accessibility provided by it.
            The opportunity for all the users to receive and to deliver all kinds of information,
            regardless of the information format or the type of user profile,
            state or impairment is a recurrent need in web applications.
            One of the means to achieve accessibility is the design of a more
            synergic interaction based on the discovery of multimodal Modality Components.

            Synergy is two or more entities functioning together to produce a result
            that is not obtainable independently.
            It means "working together".
            For example,
            how to avoid disruptive interactions
            in nomadic systems (always affected by the changing context)
            is an important issue.
            In these applications,
            user interaction is difficult,
            distracted and less precise.
            Discovery and use of alternative input and output devices
            can increase synergic interaction offering new possibilities
            more adapted to the current context.
            Such a system can also enhance the fusion process for target groups of
            users experiencing permanent or temporary learning difficulties or with sensorial,
            emotional or social impairments.

            He can point at things, sketch, clap, make gestures, but he can not make any precise movements.
            A generic interface allows this person to perform his most important tasks in his
            personal devices:
            to call someone, open a mailbox, access his agenda or navigate over some Web pages.
            The generic interface can propose child-oriented intuitive interfaces like a
            clapping-based interface,
            a very articulated TTS component, or reduced gesture input widgets.
            Other specialized devices might include phones with very big numbers,
            very simple remote controls,
            screens displaying text at high resolution,
            or voice command devices.

            Many of today's home IoT-enabled devices can provide similar functionality
            (e.g. audio/video playback),
            differing only in certain aspects of the user interface.
            This use case would allow continuous interaction with a specific
            application as the user moves from room to room,
            with the user interface switched automatically to the set of
            devices available in the user's present location.

            On the other hand,
            some devices can have specific capabilities
            and user interfaces that can be used to add information to a larger context
            that can be reused by other applications and devices.
            This drives the need to spread an application across different devices
            to achieve a more user-adapted and meaningful interaction according to the
            context of use.
            Both aspects provide arguments for exploring use cases where
            applications use distributed multimodal interfaces.

            A home entertainment system is adapted by a mobile device
            as a set of user interface components.

            In addition to media rendering and playback,
            these Devices also act as input or output modalities for
            an application, for example an application running on a smartphone.
            The native user interface on the application
            does not have to be manipulated directly at all.
            A wall-mounted touch-sensitive TV could be used to navigate applications,
            and a wide-range microphone can handle speech input.
            Spatial (Kinect-style) gestures may also be used to control
            application behavior.

            Accessibility support software on the smartphone
            discovers available modalities and arranges them to best
            serve the user's purpose.
            One display can be used to show photos and movies,
            another for navigation.
            As the user walks into another room,
            this configuration is adapted dynamically to the new location.
            User intervention may be sometimes required to decide on
            the most convenient modality configuration.
            The state of the interaction is maintained
            while switching between modality sets.
            For example,
            if the user was navigating a GUI menu in the living room,
            it is carried over to another screen when she switches rooms,
            or replaced with a different modality such as voice
            if there are no displays in the new location.

            Smart home functionality (window blinds, lights, air conditioning etc.)
            is controlled through a multimodal interface,
            composed from modalities built into the house itself
            (e.g. speech and gesture recognition)
            and those available on the user's personal devices
            (e.g. smartphone touchscreen).
            The system may automatically adapt to the preferences of a specific user,
            or enter a more complex interaction if multiple people are present.

            Sensors built into various devices around the house can act as input
            modalities that feed information to the home and affect its behavior.
            For example,
            lights and temperature in the gym room can be adapted dynamically
            as workout intensity recorded by the fitness equipment increases.
            The same data can also increase or decrease volume and tempo of music tracks
            played by the user's mobile device or the home's media system.

            User interface personalization is a task that most often needs to be repeated
            for all Devices a user wishes to interact with recurringly.
            With complex devices,
            this task can also be very time-consuming,
            which is problematic if the user regularly accesses similar,
            but not identical devices, as in the case of several cars rented over a month.

            A standardized set of personal information and preferences that could be used
            to configure personalizable devices automatically would be very helpful for all
            these cases in which the interaction becomes a customary practice.

            Basic in-car functionality is standardized to be managed by other devices.
            A user can control seat, radio or AC settings through a personalized multimodal interface
            shared by the car and her personal mobile device.
            User preferences are stored on the mobile Device (or in the cloud),
            and can be transferred across different car models handling a specific functionality
            (e.g. all cars with touchscreens should be able to adapt to a "high contrast" preference).

            The car can make itself available as a complex modality component that wraps around all
            functionality and supported modalities,
            or as a collection of modality components such as touchscreen, speech recognition system,
            or audio player.
            In the latter case,
            certain user preferences may be shared with other environments.

            For example,
            a user may opt to select the "high contrast" scheme at night on all of her displays,
            in the car or at home.
            A car that provides a set of modalities can be also adapted by the mobile device
            to compose an interface for its functionality,
            for example to manage playback of music tracks through the car's voice control system.
            Sensor data provided by the phone can be mixed with data recorded by the car's own sensors
            to profile user behavior which can be used as context in multimodal interaction.

            A smart grid integrates all players in the electricity market into one overall system through the
            interaction of generation, storage, grid management and consumption. Power and storage plants are already
            controlled today in such a way that only as much electricity is produced as is needed. Smart grids include
            consumers as well as small, decentralized energy suppliers and storage locations in this control system,
            so that on the one hand, consumption is more homogeneous in terms of time and space (see also intelligent
            electricity consumption) and on the other hand, in principle inhomogeneous producers (e.g. wind power) and
            consumers (e.g. lighting) can be better integrated.

            The term Smart Grid refers to the communicative networking and control of power generators, storage
            facilities, electrical consumers, and grid equipment in power transmission and distribution networks for
            electricity supply. This enables the optimization and monitoring of the interconnected components. The aim
            is to secure the energy supply on the basis of efficient and reliable system operation.

            <p>Decentralized Power Generation</p>

            While electricity grids with centralized power generation have dominated up to now, the trend is moving
            towards decentralized generation plants, both for generation from fossil primary energy through small CHP
            plants and for generation from renewable sources such as photovoltaic systems, solar thermal power plants,
            wind turbines and biogas plants. This leads to a much more complex structure, primarily in the area of
            load control, voltage maintenance in the distribution grid and maintenance of grid stability. In contrast
            to medium to large power plants, smaller, decentralised generation plants also feed directly into the
            lower voltage levels such as the low-voltage grid or the medium-voltage grid. This use case variants also
            includes operation and control of energy storages like batteries.

            <p>Virtual Power Plants</p>

            A Virtual Power Plant (VPP) is an aggregation of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) that can act as an
            entity on energy markets or as an ancillary service to grid operation.
            The individual DERs often have a primary use on their own, with electric generation/consumption being a
            side-effect resp. secondary use. This results in negotiations/collaborations between many different
            parties e.g. such as the DER owner, the VPP operator, the grid operator and others.

            <p>Smart Metering</p>
            For consumers, a major change is the installation of smart meters. Their core tasks are remote reading and
            the possibility to realize fluctuating prices within a day at short notice. All electricity meters must
            therefore be replaced by those with remote data transmission.

              <li>Multi-Stakeholder Operation: Multiple involved parties have to find a common mode of operation</li>
              <li>Device Lifecycle Management: Since the VPP is a dynamic system of loosely coupled DERs, the
                appearance and disappearance of DERs as well as the software management on the devices itself requires
                a means to orchestrate the lifecycle of individual device's respective components.</li>
              <li>Embedded Runtime: Especially for DERs in remote locations, maintaining a close couple control loop
                can be expensive if feasible at all. Therefore, it is desirable to be able to offload control logic to
                the DER itself.</li>
              <li>Ensemble Discovery: In order to dynamically find matching DERs needed for the operational goal of a
                VPP, a registry with different options of DER discovery is needed.</li>
              <li>Content-Negotiation: The different stakeholders have to interact and therefore need a common data
                format.</li>
              <li>Resource Description: The DER has to describe itself to enable discovery of single DERs and

                engineering effort.</li>
              <li>Push Services: As there is a fan-out with many devices that probably have a rate-limited connection
                connecting to one single command centre, a bidirectional communication mechanism is needed rather than
                polling for the reverse direction</li>

            Buildings such as office buildings, hotels, airports, hospitals, train stations and sports stadiums
            typically consist of heterogeneous IoT systems such as lightings, elevators, security (e.g., door
            control), air-conditionings, fire warnings, heatings, pools, parking control, etc.

            Construction and renovation companies often deal with the challenge of delivering target energy-efficient
            buildings given specific budget and time constraints. Energy efficiency, as one of the key factors for
            renovation investments, depends on the availability of various data sources to support the renovation
            design and planning. These include climate data and building material along with residential comfort and
            energy consumption profiles. The profiles are created using a combination of manual inputs and sensory
            data collected from residents.

          <dd>

            Renovation of residential buildings to improve energy efficiency depend on a wide range of sensory
            information to understand the building conditions and consumption models. As part of the pre-renovation
            activities, the renovation companies deploy various sensors to collect relevant data over a period of
            time. Such sensors become part of a wireless sensor network (WSN) and expose data endpoint with the help
            of one or more gateway devices. Depending on the protocols, the endpoints require different interaction
            flows to securely access the current and historical measurements. The renovation applications need to
            discover the sensors, their endpoints and how to interact with them based on search criteria such as the
            physical location, mapping to the building model or measurement type.

            There is no standard vocabulary for embedding application-specific meta data inside the TD. It is possible
            to extend the TD context and add additional fields but with too much flexibility, every application may
            end up with a completely different structure, making such information more difficult to discover. In this
            use-case, the application specific data are:
            <ul>
              <li>the mapping between each thing and the space in the building model</li>
              <li>various identifiers for each thing (e.g. sensor serial number, z-wave ID, SenML name)</li>
              <li>indoor coordinates</li>

            This use case motivates a standardized use of shared resources. One example is when a physical resource of
            the Thing should not be used by multiple Consumers at the same time like the arm of the robot but its
            position can be read my multiple Consumers.

            we have currently the following devices that are connected to Raspberry Pis where the WoT stack (node-wot
            or similar) is running. Concrete device models can be given upon request.

            OAuth 2.0 is an authorization protocol widely known for its usage across several web services.
            It enables third-party applications to obtain limited access to HTTP services on behalf of the resource
            owner
            or of itself.
            The protocol defines the following actors:

            <ul>
              <li>Client: an application that wants to use a resource owned by the resource owner. </li>
              <li>Authorization Server: An intermediary that authorizes the client for a particular `scope`. </li>
              <li>Resource: a web resource </li>
              <li>Resource Server: the server where the resource is stored</li>
              <li>Resource Owner: the owner of a particular web resource. If it is a human is usually referred to as an
                end-user. More specifically from the RFC:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>


            These actors can be mapped to WoT entities:
            <ul>
              <li>Client is a WoT Consumer</li>
              <li>Authorization Server is a third-party service</li>
              <li>Resource is an interaction affordance</li>
              <li>Resource Server is a Thing described by a Thing Description acting as a server. </li>
              May be a device or a service.
              <li>Resource Owner might be different in each use case.
                A Thing Description may also combine resources from different owners or web server.</li>
            </ul>
            TO DO: Check the OAuth 2.0 spec to determine exactly how Resource Owner is defined.
            Is it the actual owner of the resource (eg running the web server) or simply someone
            with the rights to access that resource?
            <br>
            The OAuth 2.0 protocol specifies an authorization layer that separates the client from the resource owner.
            The basic steps of this protocol are summarized in the following diagram:
            <pre>
     +--------+                               +---------------+

            Steps A and B defines what is known as authorization grant type or flow.
            What is important to realize here is that not all of these interactions
            are meant to take place over a network protocol.
            In some cases,
            interaction with with a human through a user interface may be intended.

            OAuth2.0 defines 4 basic flows plus an extension mechanism.
            The most common of which are:
            <ul>
              <li>`code`</li>
              <li>`implicit`</li>
              <li>`password` (of resource owner)</li>
              <li>`client` (credentials of the client)</li>
            </ul>

            In addition, a particular extension which is of interest to IoT is the `device` flow.

            Further information about the OAuth 2.0 protocol can be found in
            <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1">IETF RFC6749</a>.
            In addition to the flows, OAuth 2.0 also supports scopes.
            Scopes are identifiers which can be attached to tokens.
            These can be used to limit authorizations to
            particular roles or actions in an API.
            Each token carries a set of scopes and these can be checked when an interaction
            is attempted and access can be denied if the token does not include a scope
            required by the interaction.

            This document describes relevant use cases for each of the OAuth 2.0 authorization flows.

          <dd>

            To support OAuth 2.0, all devices must have the capability of:
            <ul>
              <li>Both the producer and consumer must be able to create and participate in a TLS connection.</li>
              <li>The producer must be able to verify an access (bearer) token (i.e. have sufficient computational
                power/connectivity). </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>Investigate whether DTLS can be used.</li>
              Certainly the connection needs to be encrypted; this is required in the OAuth 2.0 specification.
              <li>Investigate whether protocols other than HTTP can be used, e.g. CoAP.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>found an interesting IETF draft RFC about CoAP support(encrypted using various mechanisms like DTLS
                  or
                  CBOR Object Signing and Encryption): <a

          <dt>Expected Data</dt>
          <dd>

            Depending on the OAuth 2.0 flow specified, various URLs and elements need to be specified,
            for example, the location of an authorization token server.
            OAuth 2.0 is also based on bearer tokens and so
            needs to include the same data as those, for example, expected encryption suite.
            Finally,
            OAuth 2.0 supports scopes so these need to be defined in the security scheme and specified in
            the form.

          <dd>

            A general use case for OAuth 2.0 is when a WoT consumer wants to access restricted interaction
            affordances.
            In particular, when those affordances have a specific resource owner which
            may grant some temporary permissions to the consumer.

            The WoT consumer can either be hosted in a remote device or interact directly with the end-user inside an
            application.

          </dd>
          <dt>Variants</dt>
          <dd>

            For each OAuth 2.0 flow, there is a corresponding use case variant.
            We also include the experimental "device" flow for consideration.

            <br>
            <br>
            code

            A natural application of this protocol is when the end-user wants to interact directly with the consumed
            thing or to grant his authorization to a remote device. In fact from the <a
              href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1">RFC6749</a>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Since this is a redirection-based flow, the client must be capable of
                interacting with the resource owner's user-agent (typically a web
                browser) and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection)
                from the authorization server.
              </li>
            </ul>

            This implies that the code flow can be only used when the resource owner interacts directly with the WoT
            consumer at least once. Typical scenarios are:

            <ul>
              <li>In a home automation context, a device owner uses a third party software to interact
                with/orchestrate one or more devices</li>
              <li>Similarly, in a smart farm, the device owner might delegate its authorization to third party
                services.</li>
              <li>In a smart home scenario, Thing Description Directories might be deployed using this authorization
                mechanism. In particular, the list of the registered TDs might require an explicit read authorization
                request to the device owner (i.e. an human who has bought the device and installed it). </li>
              <li>... </li>
            </ul>

            The following diagram shows the steps of the protocol adapted to WoT idioms and entities. In this
            scenario, the WoT Consumer has read the Thing Description of a Remote Device and want to access one of its
            WoT Affordances protected with OAuth 2.0 code flow.

            <p>device</p>

            The device flow (IETF <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628">RFC 8628</a>) is a variant of the code
            flow for browserless and
            input-constrained devices. Similarly, to its <i>parent</i> flow, it requires a close interaction between the
            resource owner and the WoT consumer. Therefore, the use cases for this flow are the same as the code
            authorization grant but restricted to all devices that do not have a rich means to interact with the
            resource owner. However, differently from `code`, RFC 8628 states explicitly that one of the actors of
            the protocol is an <b>end-user</b> interacting with a <b>browser</b> (even if <a
              href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628#section-6.2">section-6.2</a>

            Notable mentions:
            <ul>
              <li>the protocol is heavily end-user oriented. In fact, the RFC states the following</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Due to the polling nature of this protocol (as specified in Section 3.4), care is needed to avoid
                  overloading the capacity of the token endpoint. To avoid unneeded requests on the token endpoint, the
                  client SHOULD only commence a device authorization request when <b>prompted by the user and not
                    automatically</b>, such as when the app starts or when the previous authorization session expires or
                  failAs.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>TLS is required both between WoT Consumer/Authorization Server and between Browser/Authorization
                Server</li>
              <li>Other user interactions methods may be used but are left out of scope</li>
            </ul>


            <p>client credential</p>

            The Client Credentials grant type is used by clients to obtain an access token outside of the context of
            an end-user. From <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4">RFC6749</a>:

            <ul>
              <li>The client can request an access token using only its client
                credentials (or other supported means of authentication) when the
                the client is requesting access to the protected resources under its
                control, or <b>those of another resource owner that has been previously
                  arranged with the authorization server</b> (the method of which is beyond
                the scope of this specification).</li>
            </ul>

            Therefore the client credential grant can be used:
            <ul>
              <li>When the resource owner is a public authority. For example, in a smart city context, the authority
                provides a web service where to register an application id.</li>
              <li>Companion application</li>
              <li>Industrial IoT. Consider a smart factory where the devices or services are provisioned with client
                credentials. </li>
              <li>...</li>
            </ul>

            The Client Credentials flow is illustrated in the following diagram. Notice how the Resource Owner is not
            present.

            Comment: Usually client credentials are distributed using an external service which is used by humans to
            register a particular application. For example, the `npm` cli has a companion dashboard where a developer
            requests the generation of a token that is then passed to the cli. The token is used to verify the
            publishing process of `npm` packages in the registry. Further examples are Docker cli and OpenId Connect
            Client Credentials.

                tokens in the authorization response, unless access token injection
                in the authorization, response is prevented and the aforementioned
                token leakage vectors are mitigated.
              </li>
            </ul>

            The RFC above suggests using `code` flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) instead.
            <br>
            The implicit flow was designed for public clients typically implemented inside a browser (i.e. javascript
            clients). As the `code` is a redirection-based flow and it requires direct interaction with the resource's
            owner user-agent. However, it requires one less step to obtain a token as it is returned directly in the
            authentication request (see the diagram below).
            <br>
            Considering the WoT context this flow is not particularly different from `code` grant and it can be used
            in the same scenarios.
            <br>
            Comment: even if the `implicit` flow is deprecated existing services may still using it.

            There are (at least) two different entities to consider:

            The current architecture spec does not describe device lifecycle in detail.
            A common lifecycle model helps to clarify terminology and structures the discussion
            in different groups.
            Interaction of a device with other entities such as directories may introduce
            additional states and transitions.

            Discovery defines a distribution mechanism for the metadata contained in WoT Things Descriptions,
            and allows Things to advertise their capabilities and for potential consumers to find Things that
            match their needs. A standardized discovery mechanism is an enabler for convenient and ad-hoc
            orchestration of combinations of Things from different vendors while supporting appropriate security
            and privacy controls.

          <dd>

            A user wishing to build or instantiate an IoT service needs access to Thing Descriptions of installed and
            running
            devices satisfying specific requirements. These requirements can include being in or near a certain
            location,
            accessible using particular protocols or on a certain network,
            satisfying certain semantic categories, having certain capabilities, or having specific sub-APIs
            (interfaces).
            Discovery is the general process whereby WoT Thing Descriptions satisfying a specific set of such
            constraints are retreived by a running system.

        <dd>

          Users can be guided by a virtual assistant through an area of interest with AR/VR to visualise events or
          structures and an annotated map or space to provide additional geospatial guidance in sync, including
          locations of other WoT devices. Two synchronized displays can offer greater insight and provide clearer
          guidance to the user by showing different views of the same location, e.g. a map.

            <li>A medical tool which allows a patient to describe their symptoms using AR, e.g. identify a painful area
              on their own body, which is also modelled as a 'map' to show internal features and display a treatment
              guide, including any WoT medical devices.</li>
            <li>A virtual controller for a city engineer to visualise utilities, e.g. electrical cables or water pipes,
              and control them. For example, a maintenance engineer could switch off an individual street lamp in order

        <h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
        <p>This section defines the properties required in an
          abstract Web of Things (WoT) architecture.</p>

        </section>
        <section id="sec-requirements-principles">
          <h3>Common Principles</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>WoT architecture should enable mutual
              interworking of different eco-systems using web
              technology.</li>
            <li>WoT architecture should be based on the web
              architecture using RESTful APIs.</li>
            <li>WoT architecture should allow to use
              multiple payload formats which are commonly used
              in the web.</li>
            <li>WoT architecture must enable different device
              architectures and must not force a client or server
              implementation of system components.</li>
            <li>Flexibility
              <p>There are a wide variety of physical
                device configurations for WoT
                implementations. The WoT abstract
                architecture should be able to be mapped to
                and cover all of the variations.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Compatibility
              <p>There are already many existing IoT
                solutions and ongoing IoT standardization
                activities in many business fields. The WoT
                should provide a bridge between these
                existing and developing IoT solutions and
                Web technology based on WoT concepts. The
                WoT should be upwards compatible with
                existing IoT solutions and current
                standards.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Scalability
              <p>WoT must be able to scale for IoT
                solutions that incorporate thousands to
                millions of devices. These devices may offer
                the same capabilities even though they are
                created by different manufacturers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Interoperability
              <p>WoT must provide interoperability across
                device and cloud manufacturers. It must be
                possible to take a WoT enabled device and
                connect it with a cloud service from
                different manufacturers out of the box.</p>

          The W3C WoT Thing Architecture [[wot-architecture]] defines the
          abstract architecture of Web of Things and illustrates it with various
          system topologies. This section describes
          technical requirements derived from the abstract
          architecture.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Components in the Web of Things and the Web
            of Things Architecture</h3>
          <p>The use cases help to identify basic components
            such as devices and applications, that access and
            control those devices, proxies (i.e., gateways and
            edge devices) that are located between devices.
            An additional component useful in some use cases
            is the directory, which assists with discovery.</p>
          <p>Those components are connected to the internet or
            field networks in offices, factories or other
            facilities. Note that all components involved may be
            connected to a single network in some cases,
            however, in general components can be deployed
            across multiple networks.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Devices</h3>
          <p>
            Access to devices is made using a description of
            their functions and interfaces. This description is
            called <em>Thing Description (TD)</em>. A <em>Thing
              Description</em> includes a general metadata about
            the device, information models representing
            functions, transport protocol description for
            operating on information models, and security
            information.
          </p>
          <p>General metadata contains device identifiers
            (URI), device information such as serial number,
            production date, location and other human readable
            information.</p>
          <p>Information models defines device attributes, and
            represent device’s internal settings, control
            functionality and notification functionality.
            Devices that have the same functionality have the
            same information model regardless of the transport
            protocols used.</p>
          <p>Because many systems based on Web of Things
            architecture are crossing system Domains,
            vocabularies and meta data (e.g., ontologies) used in
            information models should be commonly understood by
            involved parties. In addition to REST transports,
            PubSub transports are also supported.</p>
          <p>Security information includes descriptions about
            authentication, authorization and secure
            communications. Devices are required to put TDs
            either inside them or at locations external to the
            devices, and to make TDs accessible so that other
            components can find and access them.</p>

          <h3>Applications</h3>
          <p>Applications need to be able to generate and use network
            and program interfaces based on metadata (descriptions).</p>
          <p>Applications have to be able to obtain these
            descriptions through the network,
            therefore, need to be able to conduct search
            operations and acquire the necessary descriptions over the
            network.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Digital Twins</h3>
          <p>Digital Twins need to generate program interfaces
            internally based on metadata (descriptions),
            and to represent virtual devices by using those
            program interfaces. A twin has to produce a description for
            the virtual device and make it externally available.</p>
          <p>Identifiers of virtual devices need to be newly
            assigned, therefore, are different from the original
            devices. This makes sure that virtual devices and
            the original devices are clearly recognized as
            separate entities. Transport and security mechanisms
            and settings of the virtual devices can be different
            from original devices if necessary. Virtual devices
            are required to have descriptions provided either directly by
            the twin or to have them available at external
            locations. In either case it is required to make the
            descriptions available so that other components can find and
            use the devices associated with them.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Discovery</h3>
          <p>For TDs of devices and virtual devices to be
            accessible from devices, applications and twins,
            there needs to be a common way to share TDs.
            Directories can serve this requirement by providing
            functionalities to allow devices and twins
            themselves automatically or the users to manually
            register the descriptions.</p>
          <p>Descriptions of the devices and virtual devices
            need to be searchable by external entities.
            Directories have to be able to process search
            operations with search keys such as keywords from
            the general description in the device description or
            information models.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Security</h3>
          <p>Security information related to devices and
            virtual devices needs to be described in device
            descriptions. This includes information for
            authentication/authorization and payload
            encryption.</p>
          <p>WoT architecture should support multiple security
            mechanism commonly used in the web, such as Basic,
            Digest, Bearer and OAuth2.0.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Accessibility</h3>
          <p>The Web of Things primarily targets
            machine-to-machine communication. The humans
            involved are usually developers that integrate
            Things into applications. End-users will be faced
            with the front-ends of the applications or the
            physical user interfaces provided by devices
            themselves. Both are out of scope of the W3C WoT
            specifications. Given the focus on IoT instead of
            users, accessibility is not a direct requirement,
            and hence is not addressed within this specification.</p>
          <p>There is, however, an interesting aspect on
            accessibility: Fulfilling the requirements above
            enables machines to understand the network-facing
            API of devices. This can be utilized by
            accessibility tools to provide user interfaces of
            different modality, thereby removing barriers to
            using physical devices and IoT-related applications.</p>
