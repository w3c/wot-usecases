    <p>
      The Web of Things is applicable to multiple IoT domains,
      including Smart Home, Industrial, Smart City, Retail, and Health
      applications, where usage of the W3C WoT standards can simplify the
      development of IoT systems that combine devices from multiple vendors
      and ecosystems.
      During the last charter period of the WoT Working Group several
      specifications were developed to address requirements for
      these domains.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Use Cases and Requirements Document is created
      to collect new IoT use cases from various domains
      that have been contributed by various stakeholders.
      These serve as a baseline for identifying requirements
      for the standardization work in the W3C WoT groups.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has published the Web of Things
      (WoT) Architecture and Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description (TD) as
      official W3C Recommendations in May 2020. These specifications enable
      easy integration across Internet of Things platforms and applications.
    </p>
    <p>The W3C Web of Thing Architecture [[wot-architecture]] defines an
      abstract architecture, the WoT Thing Description [[wot-thing-description]]
      defines a format to describes a broad spectrum of very different devices,
      which may be connected over various protocols.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the inception phase of the WoT 1.0 specifications in 2017-2018
      the WoT IG collected use cases and requirements to enable
      interoperability of Internet of Things (IoT)
      services on a worldwide basis.
      These released specifications have been created to address the
      use cases and requirements for the first version of the WoT specifications,
      which are documented in <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot/ucr-doc/">
        https://w3c.github.io/wot/ucr-doc/</a>

    <p>
      The present document gathers and describes new use cases and requirements
      for future standardization work in the WoT standard.
    </p>

    <p>
      This document contains chapters describing the use cases that were contributed by multiple authors,
      functional and technical requirements on the Web of Things standards.
      Additionally it contains a summary of the liaisons, where active collaboration is taking place at the time of
      writing.
      Since this document is a WG note, additional use cases will be added in future revisions of this document.
    </p>

            Greenhouse Horticulture controlled by computers can create an optimal environment for growing plants. This
            enables to improve productivity and ensure stable vegetable production throughout the year, independent of
            the weather. This is the result of research on the growth of plants in the 1980s. For example, in
            tomatoes, switching to hydroponics and optimizing the temperature, humidity and CO2 concentration required
            for photosynthesis resulted in a five times increase in yield. The growth conditions for other vegetables
            also have been investigated, and this control system is applied now.

            Sensors and some facilities like heater, CO2 generator, sheet controllers are connected to the gateway via
            wired or wireless networks. The gateway is connected to the cloud via the Internet. All sensors and
            facilities can be accessed and controlled from the cloud.
            To maximize photosynthesis, the temperature, CO2 concentration, and humidity in the greenhouse are mainly
            controlled. When the sunlight comes in the morning and CO2 concentration inside decreases, the application
            turns on the CO2 generator to keep over 400 ppm, the same as the air outside. The temperature in the
            greenhouse is adjusted by controlling the heater and the sunlight shielding sheet.
            The cloud gathers all sensor data and the status of the facilities. The application makes the best
            configuration for the region of the greenhouse located.

            In the case of the wireless connection to the sensors, the gateway should keep the latest value of the
            sensors since the wireless connection is sometimes broken. The gateway can create a virtual entity
            corresponding to the sensor and allow the application to access this virtual entity having the actual
            sensor status like sleeping.

            Water is vital for ensuring food security to the world’s population, and agriculture is the biggest consumer
            amounting for 70% of freshwater. Field irrigation application methods are one of the main causes of water
            wastage. The most common technique, surface irrigation, wastes a high percentage of the water by wetting
            areas where no plants benefit from it. On the other hand, localized irrigation can use water more
            efficiently and effectively, avoiding both under-irrigation and over-irrigation. However, in an attempt to
            avoid under-irrigation, farmers feed more water than is needed resulting not only to productivity losses,
            but also water wastages.

            Therefore, technology should be developed and deployed for sensing water needs and automatically manage
            water supply to crops. However, open field agriculture is characterized by a quite dynamic range of
            requirements. Usually, solutions developed for one particular crop type cannot be reused in other
            cultivations. Moreover, the same field can have different crop types or different sizes/shapes during the
            years, meaning that technology to monitor the state of crop growth should be highly configurable and
            adaptive. Even agriculture and irrigation methods can change and also they are very different depending on
            the size of the field and its clime type.

            Consequently, silos applications are deployed leveraging on IoT technologies to gather data about the crop
            growth state and irrigation needs. The Web of Things may help to create a single platform where
            cost-effective applications could adapt seamlessly between different scenarios, breaking the silos and
            giving value both to the environment and the market.

            Sensor data plays a central role in Smart Agriculture. In particular, it is critical that the information
            sensed is associated with a timestamp. Common algorithms use *time series* to calculate the water needs of a
            crop.

            Furthermore, soil sensors usually are calibrated over a specific soil type (which may differ even in the
            same geographic region). For example, the calibration data for a soil moisture sensor is represented by a
            function that maps sensor output to soil water content. In literature, this function is knowns as a
            *calibration curve*. Commercial sensors are precalibrated with a "standard" curve but on most occasions, it
            fails to accurately measure the water content. Therefore, it can be configured during the installation phase
            (which may happen every time the soil is plowed).

            Finally, a crucial aspect is forecasting. Farmers use this information to actively change their management
            procedures. Services exploit it to suggest irrigation schedule or change device settings to behave
            accordingly to environmental changes.

            To summarize here it is a list of most important expected data from Open field agriculture:

            In open-field agriculture, the IoT solutions leverage on different radio protocols and devices. Usually,
            radio protocols should cover long distances (even kilometers) and be energy efficient. Devices too need to
            be energy saving as they are deployed for months and sometimes even years in harsh environments. A
            sleeping-cycle is one mechanism they use to save energy usually coordinated by *loggers/gateways* or
            preprogrammed. *Loggers* are deployed closed to sensor devices and have more storage space. They serve as
            buffers between sensors and higher services. Often *loggers* and sensors are embedded in the same board,
            otherwise, they are connected using cables or close-ranged radio protocols. On the other hand, *gateways*
            serve as a collection point for data of an entire field or farm. They are much more capable devices and
            usually are more energy-consuming. In some deployment scenarios, they host a full operating system with
            multiple software facilities installed. Otherwise, gateways only serve as relays of data sent from the
            loggers and sensors to cloud services and vice-versa. The cloud services may be partially hosted in edge
            servers to preserve data privacy and responsiveness of the whole IoT solution. Possible cloud services are:

              <li>Weather forecasting/local weather forecasting</li>
              <li>Soil digital twin to simulate and predict water content</li>
              <li>Plant digital twin (growth and water needs prediction)</li>
              <li>Irrigation advice service: combining the previous services and knowing the irrigation system topology

            Depending on the type of crops (e.g. maize), cultivated plots may need specific irrigation processes
            in outdoor environments. Depending on the country there exist some specific pedo-climatic conditions
            and some water consumption restrictions. Thus an irrigation system is installed on the plot. It is used
            on a several days basis (e.g. every 7 days), for each plot. The goal is to optimize the irrigation decision
            based on the crop development stage and the quantity of rain that has already fallen down on the plot.
            For example an important rain may postpone the irrigation decision.

            This use case aims to evaluate the number of days to delay the irrigation system, in addition to the basis
            irrigation frequency (e.g. 2 delay days means 9 days between two irrigations).

                    soil around the probe is too dry and the soil matter is not connected to the probe). The median
                    value
                    of three different tensiometers at the same depth will improve the accuracy of the moisture
                    measurement.</li>
                  <li>Then the sum of the two median values at two different depths is evaluated, to take into account
                    the
                    quantity of water available in the root zone volume. This aggregated value estimates the root zone
                    moisture level. </li>
                  <li>The root zone moisture level is compared to some thresholds (dependent on the crop growth stage)
                    to
                    evaluate if the crop needs water or not at the end of the basis irrigation period.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>To determine the <b>number of delay days</b>, we need:
                <ul>
                  <li>The time period between two waterings of the same plot is dependent on the farm and known by the
                    farmer. When a watering is launched, no new watering should be planned during the basic irrigation
                    frequency. The quantity of rain that falls down on the plot may postpone the watering plan. The
                    total
                    quantity of rain per day is compared to some thresholds to determine the number of delay days.</li>

              </li>
            </ul>

            The mobile pluviometer is used to validate that the quantity of water received by the crop actually
            corresponds to the quantity of water provided by the watering system.
            <br>
            <br>
            At the end, the farmer may decide if they follow the irrigation recommendations or not. They could force the
            watering for one of the next days.

            To avoid Property right and consent management issues between farmers and cloud service providers on these
            computed data, sensors are connected to the farm infrastructure and the services that evaluate aggregated
            data are executed locally on this infrastructure.

            <br>
            The tensiometers are located inside the farm. The tensiometers and the mobile pluviometer are connected
            using wireless communication to the gateway. The gateway sends the measurements to the farm infrastructure.

            The 6 tensiometers and 1 pluviometer are installed on the plot, but only the farmer should be able to change
            their configurations (frequency of communication). Wireless communication should be used but the measurement
            data should only be accessible through the farm network infrastructure.

          <dt>Privacy Considerations</dt>
          <dd>

            Data concerning quantity of water, type of seed, sowing day should be protected.

          </dd>
          <dt>Gaps</dt>
          <dd>

            The main potential issues come from tensiometers located in the plot, as they are known to be cheap and easy
            to use probes but not always reliable. They can face multiple issues: if the soil gets too dry or the probe
            is improperly installed, there may be air between the probe and the soil, therefore preventing the probe
            from providing accurate conductivity measurements.
            <br>
            <br>
            To be sure of the quality of those measurements each tensiometer sends its measurements several times (3 to
            5) per day. The tensiometer may send an inappropriate value due to the bad connection between the soil and
            the probe, that is the reason why three tensiometers are used and the median value is computed. If the
            gateway does not receive the value of one sensor during a whole day, an alert should be sent. To take an
            irrigation decision, at least one measurement per sensor and per day should be provided.
            <br>
            <br>
            The gateway can create a virtual entity corresponding to the sensor and allow the application to access this
            virtual entity having the actual sensor status like sleeping.
            <br>
            <br>
            Sensor nodes deployed in outdoor environments may take into account that their energy supply device
            (battery, solar panel) constrains the lifetime of the device. Thus they should be able to alert that they
            may not be able to provide a service due to lack of energy or they should be able to change their
            configuration and switch communication protocols to save as much energy as possible.
            <br>
            <br>
            Moreover wireless communication can be impacted by weather conditions or any outdoor conditions. For example
            a tractor that comes too close to the sensor node may move the communication device and destroy some
            components. Some kind of network supervision must be achieved (for instance by the gateway) to check node
            availability.

            This use case has been implemented in France, following local conditions and regulations. There exists an
            open manual irrigation decision method called <a
              href="http://www.irrinov.arvalisinstitutduvegetal.fr/irrinov.asp">IRRINOV®</a> developed by Arvalis [2]
            and INRAE dedicated to France and some specific crops: maize, wheat and cereals, potatoes and beans.
            <br>
            <br>
            IRRINOV® can be automated using wireless sensor networks and semantic web technologies. The considered
            network is of star type: all sensors can communicate with a common gateway, which is connected to the
            Internet. The IRRINOV® implementation was developed in [3]. This work presents an expert system for maize
            using drools. It automates the irrigation decision for maize based on sensor measurements.

	    <p>
	    Dairy farming requires significant labor in the feeding, milking, breeding, and manure disposal as well as the control and management of
	    the environmental conditions inside and outside the livestock barn. In particular, the milking accounts for more than 40% of the total
	    working time for handling a cow.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    Recently, advanced countries in the dairy industry have introduced an IoT-based automatic milking system using various IoT devices and
	    equipment to reduce the labor for milking. The automatic milking system (AMS) with IoT devices and equipment, such as sensors,
	    high performance cameras, laser equipment, and robot arms, can perform the entire milking process which includes identification of cows
	    entering the milking box, washing udders, milking, collection, sterilization, storage, and milk composition analysis. The AMS has advantage
	    of solving the labor shortage problem in the dairy farm by enabling labor allocation for tasks other than milking unlike conventional methods
	    like pipeline, herringbone, tandem machines, etc. In addition, the AMS can improve productivity and quality of milk while reducing the
	    incidence rate of disease in cows.

	    <p>
	    When a cow enters a milking box, a object identifier installed in the milking room identifies the cow’s ID from the RFID tag, QR code or bar code attached to the cow.
	    Through this, the milking can be performed more systematically based on historical data, such as the number of milking or milk yield, managed by AMS.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    Then, 3D camera, laser equipment, and sensors accurately identify the position of udders, and the robot arm attaches the milking cups to the udders
	    quickly to perform milking. Before and after the milking, cleaning and disinfection should be performed to remove any contaminant and bacteria.
	    A sensor installed in the milking cup measures the elapsed time and milk yield during milking.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    In addition, the components of milk, which are content of fat, protein, lactose, etc., are analyzed, and the analysis results are transmitted
	    to the AMS in order to manage the quality of milk, disease and health status of the cow. After milking, the milk is delivered to a milk tank
	    with cooling capability to maintain freshness of the milk. The AMS collects the data generated during the entire milking process, and analyzes
	    the data to establish a milk production strategy of a dairy farm. The farmer or the manager of a dairy farm can monitor the milking process
	    through a web page or a mobile app.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    Automated system should be designed to minimize human intervention; however, it is more desirable to have the capability to directly control
	    the AMS in order to respond to an emergency situation.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    The devices and equipment such as RFID reader/tags, milking cups, robot arms, milk component analyzer, and sensor are connected to a gateway,
	    which is a controller, installed in a dairy farm through wired or wireless networks. The gateway controlling various actuators and transferring
	    the data is connected to the cloud system through the Internet. Thus, all devices and equipment on the dairy farm can be accessed and controlled
	    through the cloud. The cloud utilizes technologies, such as AI and big data, to analyze the data transferred from the AMS. The analysis result
	    can be shared and distributed to all stakeholders and can be utilized as basic information for the creation of various new services enhancing
	    productivity and convenience of the dairy farm.

	    In addition to farmers, various stakeholders such as farm workers, service providers, manufacturers, consumers of agricultural products,

	    characteristics generated during the operation of the AMS can be shared and distributed to one or more stakeholders.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    Consequently, the right to access the data must be systematically managed according to the type, characteristics, and purpose of data utilization.
	    Through this, it is possible to protect the experience, know-how and unique agricultural knowledge or techniques of a farmer, and to secure the

	    In general, a gateway, which is a controller, installed in a dairy farm collects data and transmits the data to an external cloud connected through
	    a network. The gateway also delivers the control commands received from the cloud to the various actuators through the network.
	    However, if data loss or delay occurs due to a bottleneck, a disconnection between the gateway and the cloud, or due to the excessive internal
	    processing time of the cloud, it may be difficult to perform efficient and reliable milking operations. In order to solve these problems,
	    it is recommended to applying edge computing technologies to maintain essential functionalities for performing agricultural works including the milking.

          <dd>
              Recently, the interest in pest control using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), such as drones, for open-field agriculture is
              growing as the technology related to smart agriculture is advanced.<br><br>
              UAVs equipped with high-performance cameras and a variety of sensors closely monitor a wide range of agricultural land
              and detect unique spectral signals of crops. Meanwhile, sensors installed on the ground collect crop-growth status information.
              The data collected by UAVs and ground sensors are analyzed using various technologies including AI.
              UAVs take appropriate pest control, if the occurrence of pests is identified according to the analysis results.
              UAVs can set the target area and use the minimum amount of pesticides on the area in order to improve the productivity of
              farmhouses while minimizing the damage caused by pests. The pest control using UAVs can alleviate the labor shortage in
              rural areas due to the decrease of the agricultural population and the aging of the farmers.
              In addition, UAVs can also be an effective solution to protect farmers from serious side effects of pesticides by reducing
              the frequency of farmer’s contact with chemicals such as pesticides.

              <li>In data collection step, UAVs collect data, such as images and/or videos, on farmland and crops by using built-in high-performance
                  cameras and sensors, and transmit them to the cloud. In addition, the sensors installed on the ground collect data related to
                  the soil condition and crop-growth status and transmit them to the cloud through a controller.</li>
              <li>In data analysis and prescription step, the cloud analyzes the collected data using various technologies including AI and big data technologies
                  to identify the occurrence of pests, occurrence area and the range of occurred pests, and types of occurred pests.
                  Then the cloud generates a prescription including the type, amount, and spray method of appropriate pesticides based on the
                  analysis results. This prescription is delivered to UAVs or a separate ground-operated pest control machine.
                  To generate accurate and effective prescription, the cloud may utilize public database provided by government or related service providers.</li>
              <li>In pest control operation step, according to the prescription received from the cloud, UAVs perform pest control operation.
                  UAVs can spray the correct amount of pesticide around the area where the pests occur, depending on the type of pests and the severity of symptoms.</li>
              <li>In data utilization step, the cloud stores and manages the data collected throughout the entire process for pest control.
                  The accumulated data are used as basic materials for establishing an optimal control plan regarding the location of farmland,
                  soil condition, the types and status of crops, the types of pests. Farmers can monitor the details and results of the overall control

            IoT and AI-based animal health management technologies are being introduced to overcome the difficulty of separating sick livestock from other livestock
            in narrow spaces where many livestock herds live. This helps to safely maintain livestock by monitoring their behavior and health status and taking quick and
            appropriate responses if disease is expected or occurs.
            </p>
            <p>
            IoT and AI-based animal health management technology plays an important role in monitoring livestock health, preventing diseases, and detecting them early.
            Through this technology, livestock's health status can be monitored in real-time by collecting and analyzing their biological signals, such as body temperature,
            heart rate, and respiration, and setting normal ranges. If abnormal data is detected, it sends an alert to the famer to take appropriate measures.
            </p>
            <p>
            Additionally, AI technology can be used to predict livestock's health status. By analyzing the relationship between livestock's health status and disease occurrence
            using AI models, predictive results on health status can be provided to take preventive measures.

            Overall, livestock health management involves a complex system of data collection, transmission, processing, analysis, and decision-making. By using this,
            it is possible to improve livestock health, prevent the spread of disease, and increase productivity. Livestock health management can be described from the perspective
            of data flow as follows.
            </p>
            <p>
            (Data collection) Data for livestock health management are collected from the livestock and the livestock barn being monitored. This data can include various types of
            physiological data, such as body temperature, heart rate, respiration rate, and fecal output, as well as environmental data, such as temperature, humidity, and air quality.
            </p>
            <p>
            (Data Processing) The data is then preprocessed on edge devices before being sent to the cloud server. The preprocessing step can involve cleaning the data, compressing it,
            and performing basic analysis to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted.
            </p>
            <p>
            (Data transmission) Collected data is transmitted to a cloud server for analysis. This is typically done using wireless communication technologies such as Bluetooth,
            Wi-Fi, RFID, or cellular networks.
            </p>
            <p>
            (Data Analysis) The cloud server uses machine learning algorithms and AI models to analyze the data collected from the sensors and wearable devices.
            The analysis can include identifying patterns, predicting future health risks, and detecting early signs of illness or disease.
            </p>
            <p>
            (Decision Making) Based on the data analysis results, the livestock health management service provider or veterinarian with insights can make decisions about the care
            and treatment of the livestock. This can include taking preventative measures to reduce the risk of disease or illness, administering medication, or isolating sick livestock
            from the rest of the herd. Also, the livestock health management service provider or veterinarian establish a livestock health management plan that reflects the results of analysis.

            Smart agriculture in open fields, which covers a considerably large area, requires various types of agricultural machinery such as tractors, combines, weeders, and pesticide sprayers,
            unlike greenhouse with limited space. However, since the cost of agricultural machinery is generally high, it is important to efficiently operate and manage the machinery
            to save costs and labor required for operating them.
            </p>
            <p>
            To manage agricultural machinery efficiently, farmers need to first establish an agricultural works plan that reflects the type of agricultural works required
            for each growth stage of the crops, the estimated time required, the type and quantity of machinery needed for each agricultural works.
            By implementing the established agricultural work plan, farmers can use machinery to complete the required agricultural work in the shortest time possible.
            In addition, IoT-connected machinery can share real-time progress status of the agricultural work and, if necessary, additional idle machinery can be added
            to shorten the time required for agricultural work.
            </p>
            <p>
            Various types of sensor devices installed on agricultural machinery collect data related to environmental conditions of the field and crop growth status.
            The collected data is used for the establishment of optimal production management strategies and optimization (update) of agricultural works plan to improve the productivity
            (convenience, operating cost) of farmhouse through AI-based analysis. Farmers can monitor the operational status of the agricultural machinery and the progress
            of the agricultural work anytime, anywhere through web or mobile devices, and can also transmit appropriate instructions in case of changes in the farming plan or equipment failures.

            Efficient management of agricultural machinery is achieved through systematic management of various data, such as optimal agricultural works plans, machinery operation status,
            agricultural works execution results, and history of malfunctions or damages. This data can be analyzed based on AI and big data technology to establish the optimal
            production management strategy. Through this series of procedures, farm productivity can be improved.
            </p>
            <p>
            The farmer or agricultural machinery management service provider establish an agricultural works plan based on data such as the location of farmland,
            the types of agricultural works required, the time required to perform the agricultural works, the types of agricultural machinery required and their availability,
            and the history of past agricultural works execution. The establishment of the agricultural works plan is crucial because it serves as the basis for efficiently
            operating and managing agricultural machinery at the lowest cost possible. To establish an agricultural works plan, the farmer's requirements must be reflected,
            and consulting results from an agricultural expert group or expert system should be incorporated as necessary.
The system may also take into account factors such as local weather conditions and forecasts, including
historical conditions such as accumulated precipitation.
Management of machinery can also take into account predicted events, such as the
possible need for maintenance or repairs.
            </p>
            <p>
            Based on the established agricultural works plan, the necessary agricultural machinery is deployed and executes the corresponding agricultural works.
            During the process of agricultural works, the agricultural machinery collects and reports data on its operating status, occurrence of malfunctions or damages,
            agricultural works execution status and its results, as well as the status of the farmland and crops-growth to the farm operation system.
            The farm operation system can monitor the agricultural works progress in real-time, and can modify the agricultural works plan to immediately deploy the machinery
            that is not yet deployed or that can finish the assigned agricultural work soon, thus improving the operational efficiency of the agricultural machinery for the farm.
            </p>
            <p>
            The farm operation system analyzes the collected data comprehensively and utilizes it to update existing agricultural works plan and optimize production management
            strategies for the improvement of farm productivity. The collected and analyzed data can be shared with stakeholders, such as service providers, agricultural machinery
            manufacturers, and maintenance companies. Based on the shared data, service providers can improve the quality of agricultural machinery management services,
            while agricultural machinery manufacturers and maintenance companies can utilize the data to produce and maintain agricultural machinery that is optimized for
            the agricultural works demanded by farmers. Additionally, farmers can monitor the progress status and results of agricultural works through web or mobile devices.

              Smart Cities need to track a large number of mobile devices and sensors.
              Location information may be integrated with a logistics or fleet management
              system.
              A reusable geolocation module is needed with a common network interface to
			  include in these various applications.
              For outdoor applications, GPS
              could be used, but indoors other geolocation technologies might be
              used, such as WiFi triangulation or vision-based navigation (SLAM).
              Therefore the geolocation information should be technology-agnostic.
            </p>
            <p>
              NOTE: we prefer the term "geolocation", even indoors, over "localization" to
              avoid confusion with language localization.

              of changes in location.
              This may be used to implement geofencing by some other system.
              This may require additional parameters, such as the
              maximum distance that the device may be moved before a notification is
              sent, or the maximum amount of time between updates.
              Notifications may be sent by a variety of means, some of which may
              not be traditional push mechanisms (for example, email might be used).
              For geofencing applications, it is not necessary that the device be aware
              of the fence boundaries; these can be managed by a separate system.

              large number of mobile devices

              High-resolution timestamps can be used in conjunction with cache manipulation to
              access protected regions of memory, as with the SPECTRE exploit. Certain
              geolocation APIs and technologies can return high-resolution timestamps which
              can be a potential problem. Eventually these issues will be addressed in cache
              architecture but in the meantime a workaround is to artificially limit the
              resolution of timestamps.

              Location is generally considered private information when it is used with a device
              that may be associated with a specific person, such as a phone or vehicle, as it
              can be used to track that person and infer their activities or who they associate
              with (if multiple people are being tracked at once). Therefore APIs to access geographic location
              in sensitive contexts are often restricted, and access is allowed only after confirming
              permission from the user.

            <p>
              There is no single standardized semantic vocabulary for representing location data.
              Location data can be point data, a path, an area or a volumetric object.
              Location information can be expressed using multiple standards,
              but the reader of location data in a TD or in data returned by an IoT device
              must be able to unambiguously describe location information.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are both dynamic (data returned by a mobile sensor) and static (fixed installation
              location) applications for geolocation data. For dynamic location data, some recommended vocabulary
              to annotate data schemas would be useful. For static location data, a standard format
              for metadata to be included in a TD itself would be useful.

              Actuators can include robots; for these, commands might be given to robots to move to new locations,
              drop off or pick up sensor packages, etc.
              However, it could also include other kinds of actuators, such as flood gates, traffic signals, lights,
              signs, etc.
              For example, posting a public message on an electronic billboard might be one task possible through the
              dashboard.

              Sensors can include those for the environment and for people and traffic management
              (density counts, thermal cameras, car speeds, etc.).
              status of robots, other actuators, and sensors, data visualization,
              and (optionally) historical comparisons.

            <p>
              Dashboard would include mapping functionality.
              Mapping implies a need for location data for every actuator and sensor, which could be

            Public spaces provide many opportunities for engaging, social and fun interaction.
            At the same time,
            preserving privacy while sharing tasks and activities with other people is a major issue
            in ambient systems.
            These systems may also deliver personalized information in combination
            with more general services presented publicly.

            A trustful discovery of the services and devices available in such environments
            is a necessity to guarantee personalization and privacy in public-space applications.

            Interactive installations such as touch-sensitive or gesture-tracking billboards
            may be set up in public places.
            Objects that present public information (e.g. a map of a shopping mall)
            can use a multimodal interface (built-in or in tandem with the user's mobile devices)
            to simplify user interaction and provide faster access.
            Other setups can stimulate social activities,

            or just for fun (e.g. play a musical instrument or control a lighting exhibition).
            In a context where privacy is an issue
            (for example, with targeted/personalized alerts or advertisements),
            the user's mobile device acts as a mediator for the services

            In this use case a network full of IoT devices is presented, in which these devices are registered in
            several Middle-Nodes. The challenge presented in this scenario is to be able to discover the different
            sensors, by issues a SPARQL query, and without having prior knowledge of where those devices are allocated.
            Therefore, the discovery SPARQL query must start from a specific Middle-Node and reach all those
            Middle-Nodes that are relevant to answer the query.

            This scenario requires that discovery does not only happen locally when a Middle-Node receives the query and
            checks if some Thing Description registered is suitable to answer the query. Instead, the scenario requires
            also that the Middle-Node forwards the query through the network (topology conformed by the middle-nodes) in
            order to find those Middle-Nodes that actually contain relevant Thing Descriptions. Notice from the
            following example that the query is not broadcasted in the network to prevent flooding, instead the
            Middle-Nodes follow some discovery heuristic to know where the query should be forwarded. Also, notice that
            in this scenario not all the Middle-Nodes have the IoT devices registered directly within, they are
            Middle-Nodes collectors, such as Middle-Node C, I, G, and D.

          <dt> Description</dt>
          <dd>
            A campus has a wide range of IoT devices distributed across their grounds. These IoT devices belong to very
            different domains in a smart city, such as, energy, buildings, environment, water, wearable, etc. The IoT
            devices are distributed across the campus and belong to different infrastructures or even to individuals. A
            sample topology of this scenario could be the following:

            <br>
            <br>

            <div class="resize"><img src="images/smart-campus-topology.svg" alt="sample topology of a smart campus">
            </div>
            <br>
            <br>

            In this scenario, energy-related IoT devices monitor the energy use and income in the campus, among other
            things. From these measurements, an Energy Management System may predict a negative peak of incoming energy
            that would entail the failure of the whole system. In this case, a Service or a User needs to discover all
            those IoT devices that are not critical for the normal functioning of the campus (such as indoor or outdoor
            illumination, HVAC systems, or water heaters) and interact with them in order to save energy, by switching
            them off or reducing their consumption. Besides, the same Service or User will look for those IoT devices
            that are critical for the well-functioning of the campus (such as magnetic locks, water distribution system,
            or fire/smoke sensors) and ensure that they are up and running. Additionally, the Service or the User, will
            discover relevant people's wearable to warn them about the situation.

            <p>Sample flow:</p> A service, or a user, sends a (SPARQL) query to the discovery endpoint of a known
            Middle-Node (which can be wrapped by a GUI). The Middle-Node will try to answer the query first checking the
            Thing Descriptions of the IoT devices registered in such Middle-Node. Then, if the query requires further
            discovery, or it was not successfully answered the Middle-Node will forward the query to its *known*
            Middle-Nodes. Recursively, the Middle-Nodes will try to answer the query and/or forward the query to their
            known Middle-Nodes. When one Middle-Node is able to answer the query it will forward back to the former
            Middle-Node the partial query answer. Finally, when the discovery task finishes, the former Middle-Node will
            join all the partial query answers producing an unified view (which could be synchronous or asynchronous).

            <br>
            <br>

            For instance, assuming Middle-Node F receives a query that asks about all the discoverable Building IoT
            devices in the campus. First, the Middle-Node F will try to answer the query with the Thing Descriptions of
            the IoT registered within. Since Middle-Node F contains some Building IoT devices a partial query answer is
            achieved. However, since they query asked about all the discoverable Building IoT devices Middle-Node F
            should forward the query to its other known Middle-Nodes, i.e., Middle-Node G. This process will be repeated
            by the Middle-Nodes until the query reaches the Middle-Nodes H and B which are the ones that have registered
            Thing Descriptions about IoT buildings. Therefore, the query will travel through the topology as follows:
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="resize"><img src="images/smart-campus-sample.svg"
                alt="query goes through the topology for a smart campus"></div>
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally, when Middle Nodes B and H compute two partial query answers, those answers will be forwarded back
            to Middle-Node F which will join them with its former partial query answer obtained from its registered
            Thing Descriptions. Finally, a global query answer will be provided.

            <!--Provide a description of the problem that is solved by the use case and a reason why this use case is important for the users -->
            <p>
              This use case is related to the semantic modeling of trustworthy IoT entities in energy-efficient cultural
              spaces such as museums.</p>
            <p>
              Nowadays, energy-saving issues have awakened the research community's interest due to the more and more
              increasing
              global electricity demand. An excessive
              use of energy is believed to derive from public and industrial buildings to cover their daily load
              requirements in
              the context of the provision of their services.
              Thus, the necessity of developing energy-efficient buildings could be proved beneficial. Notably, the
              improvement
              of buildings' energy efficiency leads to Building
              Energy Management Systems (BEMS).
            </p>
            BEMS objectives include but not limited to:
            <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
              <li>the continuous management of energy towards energy consumption optimization;</li>
              <li>the optimization of buildings' visiting conditions towards enhancing visitors experience and
                comfort,</li>
              <li>the optimization of buildings' environmental conditions towards the protection and preservation of
              </li>
              artifacts
              (indirect contribution).
            </ol>
            <p>
              The application of BEMS in the context of energy-saving at cultural spaces, and especially at the museums'
              spaces,
              is an evolving recent research interest. The protection and preservation of artworks and ancient objects
              isolated in museums, leads to the
              necessity of continuous monitoring of the environmental
              factors and indoor conditions like temperature, humidity and CO2. This monitoring involves Internet of
              Things
              (IoT) entities, which may be considered as an
              integral part of BEMS, to reduce energy consumption without: a) sacrificing humans' visiting experience
              and
              comfort indoor levels, and b) sacrificing artworks'
              protection and preservation.
            </p>
            The aim of the presented use case is to sketch and highlight the following requirements for knowledge
            representation:
            <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
              <li>representing knowledge related to the trustworthy IoT entities that are deployed in a museum i.e.,
                things
                (e.g,
                exhibits, spaces), sensors, actuators, people, data, applications;</li>
              <li>dealing with entities' heterogeneity via semantic interoperability and integration, especially for
                'smart'
                museum applications and generated data;</li>
              <li>representing knowledge related to saving energy e.g., lights, air-conditioning;</li>
              <li>representing knowledge related to museum visits and visitors towards enhancing visiting experience
                while
                preserving comfort;</li>
              <li>representing knowledge related to environmental conditions towards protecting and preserving museum
                artwork via
                continuous monitoring.</li>

            From users perspective, this use case sketches knowledge required for an ontology-based BEMS to answer
            queries
            such as:
            <li>Which exhibits are located in UoAMuseumRoomA1?</li>
            <li>How many sensors (all kinds) are hosted by IoTmuseumPlatformLG?</li>
            <li>Which rooms have been visited by Visitor01?</li>
            <li>What temperature measurements have been made in UoAMuseumRoomA1 between 09.00 and 17.00 on 07/12/2020?
            </li>
            <li>For observations that are made for Painting01 (in UoAMuseumRoomA1) at 09.00 on 15/01/2021, what is its
              status in
              terms of its lamp brightness level and nearby visitors?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Reasoning with this knowledge, the identification of interesting exhibits and energy-related observations
              (based on sensing visitors' proximity to exhibits and observation of exhibits' lamp brightness level) is
              realized.</p>
            <p>
              For instance, if the brightness level of an exhibit's lamp is "medium" and there are more than two
              visitors
              near
              the exhibit, then this observation
              is classified as a) an interesting-exhibit observation and b) an observation to high level energy, meaning
              that
              the level of energy (light) for the
              lamp of the exhibit of this observation must be raised to high. In addition (another example), if the
              brightness
              level of the exhibit's lamp is "medium" and less
              than two visitors are nearby this, then classify this as an observation to low level energy, meaning that
              the
              level of energy (light) for the lamp of the exhibit of this observation must be raised to low. These
              examples indicate that a change (decrease or
              increase) to
              the level of light (energy) of the
              observed exhibit must be applied.

            Buildings such as office buildings, hotels, airports, hospitals, train stations and sports stadiums
            typically consist of heterogeneous IoT systems such as lightings, elevators, security (e.g. door
            control), air-conditionings, fire warnings, heatings, pools, parking control, etc.

            Construction and renovation companies often deal with the challenge of delivering target energy-efficient
            buildings given specific budget and time constraints. Energy efficiency, as one of the key factors for
            renovation investments, depends on the availability of various data sources to support the renovation
            design and planning. These include climate data and building material along with residential comfort and
            energy consumption profiles. The profiles are created using a combination of manual inputs and sensory
            data collected from residents.

          <dd>

            Renovation of residential buildings to improve energy efficiency depend on a wide range of sensory
            information to understand the building conditions and consumption models. As part of the pre-renovation
            activities, the renovation companies deploy various sensors to collect relevant data over a period of
            time. Such sensors become part of a wireless sensor network (WSN) and expose data endpoint with the help
            of one or more gateway devices. Depending on the protocols, the endpoints require different interaction
            flows to securely access the current and historical measurements. The renovation applications need to
            discover the sensors, their endpoints and how to interact with them based on search criteria such as the
            physical location, mapping to the building model or measurement type.

            There is no standard vocabulary for embedding application-specific meta data inside the TD. It is possible
            to extend the TD context and add additional fields but with too much flexibility, every application may
            end up with a completely different structure, making such information more difficult to discover. In this
            use-case, the application specific data are:
            <ul>

            <p>When operating smart buildings, aggregating and managing all data provided by heterogeneous devices in
              these buildings still require a lot of manual effort. Besides the hurdles of data acquisition that
              relies on multiple protocols, the acquired data generally lacks contextual information and metadata
              about its location and purpose. Usually, each service or application that consumes data from building
              things requires information about its content and its context like, e.g.:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>which thing produces the data (sensor, meter, actuator, other technical component...) in a building;
              </li>
              <li>which physical quantity or process is represented (temperature, energy supply, monitoring,
                actuation);</li>
              <li>which other building things are involved (e.g. sensor hosted by a duct or a space).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Through the increased use of model-based data exchange over the whole life cycle of a building, often
              referred to as Building Information Modeling (BIM) (Sacks et al., 2018), a curated source for data
              describing the building
              itself is available including, amongst others, the topology of the building structured into e.g. sites,
              stores and spaces.</p>
            <p>Automatically tracking down data and their related things in a building would especially ease the
              configuration and operation of Building Automation and Control Systems (BACS) and Heating
              Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) services during commissioning, operation, maintenance and
              retrofitting. To tackle these challenges, still, building experts make use of metadata and naming
              conventions which are manually implemented in Building Management Systems (BMS) databases to annotate
              data and things. An important property of a thing is its location within the topology of a building as
              well
              as where its related data are produced or used. For example, this applies to the temperature sensor of a
              space,
              the temperature setpoint of a zone, a mixing damper flap actuator of a HVAC component, etc. In addition,
              other
              attributes of things are of interest, such as cost or specific manufacturer data. One difficulty is
              especially the lack of a standardized way of creating, linking and sharing this information in an
              automated manner. On the contrary, manufacturers, service providers and users introduce their own
              metadata for their own purpose. As a solution, the Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description (TD) aims at
              providing normalized and syntactic interoperability between things.</p>
            <p>To support this effort, this use case is motivated by the need to enhance semantic interoperability
              between things in smart buildings and to provide them with contextual links to building information. This
              building information is usually obtained from a BIM model. The use case builds on Web of Data technologies
              and reuses schemas available from the Linked Building Data domain. It should serve as a use case template
              for many applications in an Internet of Building Things (IoBT).</p>

          <p>The scenario considered is related to the replacement of a temperature sensor in a BACS. The topological

          <dt><em>Automated Update of Fault Detection Rule based on Thing Description</em></dt>
          <p>Another related use case in smart buildings, which would greatly benefit from harmonised thing
            descriptions and attached location information is related to the detection of unexpected behavior,
            errors and faults. An example for such a detection of faults is the rule-based surveillance of sensor
            values. A generic rule applicable to sensors is that the observation values stay within the measurement
            range of the sensor. Again, in the case of maintenance as described above a sensor is replaced.</p>
          <p>Some agent configuring fault detection rules can obtain the measurement range from the sensor&#39;s TD
            (see above) to obtain the parameters to configure the mentioned rule. Again, a query or API call
            retrieving this information (schema:minValue/ schema:maxValue) can be used to update the upper and lower
            bound of the values provided by the <a href="#TemperatureSensor">sensor</a>.</p>

          <dt>Security Considerations</dt>
          <dd>

            <p>Security in smart buildings is of importance. In particular, access control needs to be properly secured.
              This applies also for data access which can be secured using existing security schemes (API Keys,
              OAuth2...).
              Moreover, from certain observations, e.g. electricity consumption, clues can be indirectly given such as
              presence in a
              home. Hence, security needs must be defined and properly addressed.</p>

          <dt>Privacy Considerations</dt>
          <dd>

            <p>Privacy considerations can be of a concern if observations of sensors can be matched to individuals.
              It is of the responsibility of building owners, managers and users to define their own privacy policies
              for their data and share necessary consents if necessary.

            <p>Accessibility is a major concern in the buildings domain. Efforts exist in also providing accessibility
              data in a
              electronic format. The W3C LBD CG is in contact with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/lda/">W3C

          <dt>Internationalization (i18n) Considerations</dt>

            <p>Internationalization is a concern as the Buildings industry is a global industry. This is reflected in
              some efforts, e.g. BOT used in the examples above does provide multilanguage labels in up to 16
              different languages including english, french and chinese.</p>

              For the realization of the intented use case for automated things location and fault detection as well as further potentially
              automatable analyses, a smart building or smart home ecosystem is required. More specifically, BACS components are needed
              that support existing communication protocols (e.g. MQTT, OPC-UA, CoAP, BACNet...) to share data and metadata
              with each other and necessary gateways or smart hubs. They should be able to share information that can be translated into JSON
              payloads following the data structuration and representation proposed by the

          <dt>Motivation</dt>
          <dd>

            The growing adoption of energy management systems, building automation and management systems and IoT
            devices is producing larger volumes and varieties of data.
            As a result, data-driven smart building applications are becoming increasingly common and practical to
            adopt.
            Examples of these applications include:
            <ul>
              <li>automated fault detection and diagnosis</li>
              <li>virtual metering (calculating the energy or power consumption of a subsystem that is not directly
                metered)</li>
              <li>building performance measurement and energy audits</li>
              <li>predictive occupancy, energy consumption models</li>
              <li>high-performance "sequences of operations" for various subsystems, such as HVAC</li>
            </ul>

            There is still significant cost in deploying these applications because of the effort required to customize
            and configure their operation for each individual building.
            While ontologies exist for describing sensors and the data they produce and for describing the spatial
            topology of buildings, the applications above require modeling the context of data sources that are embedded
            <strong>within</strong> building subsystems.
            Therefore, there is a need to model the topology and composition of building subsystems, including HVAC
            systems, lighting systems, electrical systems, domestic water systems and hot and chilled water systems.
            This must be done in a way that adequately contextualizes data but also provides necessary metadata to
            determine which applications or which analyses are appropriate.

              In these settings, devices are usually not commercial off-the-shelf IoT devices, but rather "packaged
              units"
              and other "lower level" devices that perform physical tasks on behalf of a larger system: pumps, fans,
              variable frequency drives, variable air volume boxes and chillers are all examples.
              Such devices are connected to one another using wires, pipes, ducts and other mechanisms.
              Sensors, actuators and other data sources and sinks are associated with the devices in these subsystems.
              Through some digital control system, they relay telemetry on the current behavior, status and performance
              of
              devices and properties of the substances and media touched by the building subsystem.

              It is important for descriptions of these systems to be built on standardized, well-known names for
              equipment and other devices in building subsystems. Reliance on generic terminology is not sufficient to
              distinguish the different kinds of systems and different kinds of equipment in a broadly consistent and
              interpretable manner. Research and practice shows that a common terminology must be established in order
              to
              reduce the costs associated with developing and deploying data-driven applications that touch the
              internals
              of cyber-physical systems.

              To support this use case, WoT descriptions should describe the networked devices present in building
              subsystems and their data capabilities.
              These capabilities should be related to properties of the substances or media that a device is operating
              on.
              For example, a smart thermostat's API may present a "mode" as a read-only property.
              "Mode" commonly refers to what the thermostat is "calling for", e.g. cooling, heating, fan; this is
              commonly
              captured as a numerical value.
              The mode is read by HVAC equipment, such as a rooftop-unit, which then enacts the desired conditioning.
              The WoT description of the mode property should permit the determination of what properties of <em>other
                devices and entities in the building</em> may be affected by the value of the mode property.
              In this example, the mode property representation should indicate that the mode property indirectly
              affects
              the temperature of air in the rooms that are connected to the equipment controlled by the thermostat.

            <p><strong>Example: Rogue Zone Detection</strong></p>
            <p>
              "Rogue zones" are regions of the building that drive demand by calling for heating or cooling
              significantly
              more than other zones. One simple way to detect rogue zones is to observe zones (which may consist of
              multiple rooms) which are consistently above or below their setpoint by more than some delta. The
              following
              SPARQL query uses Brick to identify the air temperature setpoint and sensors associated with terminal
              units,
              and to identify the zones fed by those terminal units.

            <p><strong>Example: Measuring Temperature Before and After a Cooling Coil</strong></p>
            <p>
              A common fault detection and diagnosis operation is to detect broken or underperforming cooling coils.
              These
              are hollow loops through which chilled water flows; the loops are placed into an air stream in order to
              cool
              the air. The flow of chilled water through the coil is controlled by a valve. In order to tell if the coil
              is broken or underperforming, the temperature of the air <em>before</em> and <em>after</em> the coil is
              measured. If the
              temperature after the coil is not appreciably lower than the temperature before the coil <em>while the
                valve is
                open</em>, then there may be a fault on the coil.

          <dd>

            It is important to protect access to this representation of the building and its devices; access to the
            model can reveal the uses of space within the building and what equipment is required to make those spaces
            comfortable and safe. Proper threat models, modes of access and effective security must all be developed.

          </dd>
          <dt>Privacy Considerations</dt>
          <dd>

            With the detail available in the model, it is possible to associate data sources with the spaces in the
            building (indeed, this is one of the purposes of the use case) which may then be linked to individuals or
            organizations within the building. It is of the responsibility of building owners, managers and users to
            define their own privacy policies for their data and share necessary consents if necessary.

          <dt>Accessibility Considerations</dt>
          <dd>

            Accessibility is a major concern in the buildings domain. Efforts exist in also providing accessibility data
            in a electronic format. The W3C LBD CG is in contact with the <a

          <dt>Internationalisation (i18n) Considerations</dt>
          <dd>

            Internationalization is a concern as the building industry is a global industry. Not only are translations
            of the concepts and properties to other languages necessary, but the ontology should give consideration to
            alternative categories and organizations. For example, in hot and humid climates, the term HVAC (*Heating*,
            Ventilation and Air Condition) is often abandoned in favor of ACMV (Air-Conditioning and Mechanical
            Ventilation) due to the lack of a need for heating.

              A very useful feature would be semantic descriptions of standard enumerations of device statuses, alarms
              and
              other multi-valued properties.
              One example is the numerical encoding of the thermostat mode above (e.g. "0 means off", "1 means 1-stage
              heat", etc.).
            </p>
            <p>
              Many of the semantics are standard across manufacturers and models because they describe well-known and
              industry standard properties that must be accessible by users, but are encoded in different ways.
              The ability to refer to standardized error codes, device status, and so on would be a tremendous advance
              towards enabling vendor-agnostic treatment of data.

              Production lines for industrial manufacturing consist of multiple machines, where each machine
              incorporates sensors for various values.
              A failure of a single machine can cause defective products or a stop of the entire production.
            </p>
            <p>
              Big data analysis enables to identify behavioral patterns across multiple production lines of the entire
              production plant and across multiple plants.
            </p>
            <p>
              The results of this analysis can be used for optimizing consumption of raw materials, checking the status
              of production lines and plants and predicting and preventing fault conditions.

              A company owns multiple factories which contain multiple production lines.
              Examples are production lines and environment sensors.
              These devices collect data from multiple sensors and transmit this information to the cloud. Sensor data
              is stored in the cloud, can be visualized and analyzed using machine learning / AI.
            </p>
            <p>
              The cloud service allows to manage single and groups of devices.
              Combining the data streams from multiple devices allows to get an easy overview of the state of all
              connected devices in the user's realm.
            </p>
            <p>
              In many cases there are groups of devices of the same kind, so the aggregation of data across devices can
              serve to identify anomalies or to predict impending outages.
            </p>
            <p>
              The cloud service allows to manage single and groups of devices and can help to identify abnormal
              conditions.
              For this purpose a set of rules can be defined by the user, which raises alerts towards the user or
              triggers actions on devices based on these rules.
            </p>
            <p>
              This enables the early detection of pending problems and reduces the risk of machine outages, quality
              problems or threats to the environment or life of humans. It increases production efficiency,
              improves production logistics (such as raw material delivery and production output).

            Industry 4.0 is associated with next generation of manufacturing to increase efficiency, flexibility, and
            productivity. This also includes the broader interplay between the OT and IT domain as well as the further
            integration of services from different application areas. Technology domains such as from smart infrastructure
            and web forecasting services like traffic and weather forecasts are expected to be integrated directly into
            the manufacturing process as well as in the product lifecycle. To realize cross-domain applications for the
            Industrie 4.0 context, a frequent exchange with suppliers or local infrastructure providers (e.g., power
            supplier) is needed and it is necessary to interact with manufacturing systems that usally offers an OPC UA [[OPC UA]]
            interface. WoT can act as a common and standardized application layer and can be used to support Industry 4.0
            use cases. In this context, well-formed bindings for most established industry standards such as OPC UA should
            be supported.

            to be a formal definition to map the interaction affordances of a TD to OPC UA. In that context an official
            OPC UA Binding Note document schould be developed that can be used as official reference to design Thing
            Descriptions for OPC UA use cases.

          <dt>Description</dt>
          <dd>
            A bottling line consists of a filling module (switchable between 2 fillers and 4 fillers), a capping module, a
            labeling module, and a transport system. The production line is provided via an OPC UA endpoint for control
            and monitoring purposes.
            <div class="resize"><img src="images/industry-4.0.png" alt="Bottling Line Example"></div>
            In the context of enhancing productivity and sustainability, the goal is to operate the bottling line in such
            a way that production is further increased when sufficient or surplus renewable energy is available.
            The backend system checks periodically a Smart Grid endpoint (via HTTP) how the current power production is
            and how much renewable energy is produced.
            Based on the bottling line's current power consumption, which is measured via Modbus, the backend system
            decides to increase productivity when surplus renewable energy is available.
            In doing so, the backend system interacts via OPC UA to release the 4 fillers of the filling module and
            increases the speed of the transport system.
            If the backend system detects that less renewable energy is being produced, it will initiate standard
            production and reduce the transport speed and return the 2 fillers of the filling module.

          <dt>Security Considerations</dt>
          <dd>
            OPC UA has different security modes (sign and/or encrypted, policies, and authentication). Those should be
            addressed and described in Thing Descriptions with a standardized vocabulary definition. Additional security
            considerations may apply if a web bridge is created using WoT servients. OT networks are often isolated and
            OPC UA may have special requirements for distribution of key materials and credentials.

        <dt>Description</dt>
        <dd>

          Falling costs of sensors, communications, and handling of very large volumes of data combined with cloud
          computing enable retail business operations with increased operational efficiency, better customer
          service,
          and even increased revenue growth and return on investment.

          Accurate forecasts allow retailers to coordinate demand-driven outcomes that deliver connected customer
          interactions.
          They drive optimal strategies in planning, increasing inventory productivity in retail supply chains,
          decreasing operational costs and driving customer satisfaction from engagement, to sale, to fulfilment.

          Understanding of store activity juxtaposed with traditional information streams can boost worker and
          consumer safety,
          comply better with work safety regulations, enhance system and site security, and improve worker
          efficiency
          by providing real-time visibility into worker status, location, and work environment.

        <dt>Security Considerations</dt>
        <dd>

          <ul>
            <li>In retail, replay attacks can cause monetary loss, customers may be incorrectly charged or
              over-charged.</li>
            <li>To avoid replay attacks, "Things" should implement a sequence number for each message and digital
              signature.</li>
            <li>Servers ("Things" or "Cloud") should verify the signature and disallow for duplicated messages.</li>
            <li>For "Things" relying on electronic payments, "Things" must comply with PCI-DSS requirements.</li>
            <li>"Things" must never store credit card information.</li>
            <li>Customer satisfaction and trust depends on availability, so attacks such as Denial-of-Service (DoS)
              need to be prevented or mitigated.</li>
            <li>To prevent DoS, implement "Things" with early DoS detection.</li>
            <li>Have an automated DoS system that will notify the controlling unit of the problem.</li>
            <li>Implement IP white list, that could be part of the DoS early detection system.</li>
            <li>Make sure your network perimeter is defended with up to date firewall software.</li>
          </ul>

        </dd>
        <dt>Privacy Considerations</dt>
        <dd>

          As a general rule, personal consumer information should not be stored.
          That is especially true in the retail industry where a security breach could cause financial, reputation,
          and brand damage.
          If personal or information that can identify a consumer is to be stored,
          it should be to conduct business and with the explicit acknowledgment of the consumer.
          WoT vendors and integrators should always have a privacy policy and make it easily available.
          By default, devices should adopt an opt-out policy.
          That means, unless the consumer explicitly allowed for the data capture and storage, avoid doing it.

            Not being able to access door sensors can drive security and possible theft scenarios. Open refrigeration

            Retailers want to ensure that all the canopy lights are operational and turned on at the correct times of
            day. Lighting is important for aesthetics but also for customer and facility safety requirements. Being able
            to identify when lighting is out of order, insufficient, or enabled at the wrong times can have energy and
            safety implications, as well as affect the overall customer experience of the brand.

              A system to monitor the health of people in public places is useful to
              control the spread of infectious diseases. In particular, we would like
              to identify individuals with temperatures outside the norm (i.e. running
              a fever) and then take appropriate action. Actions can include sending
              a notification or actuating a security device, such as a gate.

              This mechanism should be non-invasive and non-contact since the solution
              should not itself contribute to the spread of infectious diseases.

              Data may also be aggregated for statistics purposes, for example, to
              identify the number of people in an area with elevated temperatures.
              This has additional requirements to avoid double-counting individuals.

              A thermal camera image is taken of a group of people
              and an AI service is used to identify faces in the image.
              The temperature of each person is then estimated from the registered face;
              for greater accuracy, a consistent location for sampling should be used, such
              as the forehead.
              The estimated temperature is compared to high (and optionally, low)
              thresholds and a notification (or other action) is taken if the
              temperature is outside the norm.
              Additional features may be extracted to identify unique individuals.

                <li>Enough information is included in the notification that the specific

                  camera is also registered with the thermal camera, then a bounding box may
                  be indicated via JSON and the RGB image included; or the bounding box could
                  be actually drawn into the sent image, or the face could be cropped out.
                  This is useful if, for example, a notification needs to be sent to health
                  or security workers who need to identify the person in a crowd.</li>
                <li>Instead of simply a notification, an action may be taken, such as closing
                  or refusing to open a gate at the entrance to a building, to prevent sick
                  employees from entering the building.</li>

              Preventable medical errors may account for more than 100,000 deaths per year in U.S. alone. These errors
              are mainly caused by failures of communication such as a chart misread or the wrong data passed along to
              machines or staffs. Part of the problem could be solved if the machines could speak to one another.
              Manufacturers have little incentive to make their proprietary code and data easily to accessible and
              process able by their competitors’ machines. So the task of middleman falls to the hospital staffs. In
              addition to saving lives, a common framework could result in collecting and recording more clinical data
              on patients, making it easier to deliver precision medicine.

              <p>
                Physiological Closed-Loop Control (PCLC) devices are a group of emerging technologies, which use
                feedback from physiological sensor(s) to autonomously manipulate physiological variable(s) through
                delivery of therapies conventionally delivered by clinician(s).
              </p>
              <p>
                Clinical scenario without PCLC. An elderly female with end-stage renal failure was given a standard
                insulin infusion protocol to manage their blood glucose, but no glucose was provided. Their blood
                glucose
                dropped to 33, then rebounded to over 200 after glucose was given. This scenario has not changed for
                decades.
              </p>
              <p>
                The desired state with PCLC implemented in an ICU. A patient is receiving an IV insulin infusion and is
                having the blood glucose continuously monitored. The infusion pump rate is automatically adjusted
                according to the real-time blood glucose levels being measured, to maintain blood glucose values in a
                target range. If the patient’s glucose level does not respond appropriately to the changes in insulin
                administration, the clinical staff is alerted.
              </p>
              <p>
                Medical devices do not interact with each other autonomously (monitors, ventilator, IV pumps, etc.)
                Contextually rich data is difficult to acquire. Technologies and standards to reduce medical errors and
                improve efficiency have not been implemented in theater or at home.
              </p>
              <p>
                In recent years, researchers have made progress developing PCLC devices for mechanical ventilation,
                anesthetic delivery applications, and so on. Despite these promises and potential benefits, there has
                been limited success in the translation of PCLC devices from <a
                  href="https://today.duke.edu/2014/07/benchbedside">bench to bedside</a>. A key challenge to bringing
                PCLC devices to a level required for a clinical trials in humans is risk management to ensure device
                reliability and safety.
              </p>
              <p>
                The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies new hazards that might be introduced by
                PCLC devices into three categories. Besides clinical factors (e.g. sensor validity and reliability,
                inter- and intra-patient physiological variability) and usability/human factors (e.g. loss of
                situational awareness, errors, and lapses in operation), there are also engineering challenges including
                robustness, availability, and integration issues.

                Security considerations for interconnected and dynamically composable medical systems are critical not
                only because laws such as [[HIPAA]] mandate it, but also
                because security attacks can have serious safety consequences for patients. The systems need to support
                automatic verification that the system components are being used as intended in the clinical context,
                that the components are authentic and authorized for use in that environment, that they have been
                approved by the hospital’s biomedical engineering staff and that they meet regulatory safety and
                effectiveness requirements.

              </p>
              <p>
                While transport-level security such as TLS provides reasonable protection against external attackers,
                they do not provide mechanisms for granular access control for data streams happening within the same
                protected link. Transport-level security is also not sufficiently flexible to balance between security
                and performance. Another issue with widely used transport-level security solutions is the lack of
                support for multicast.

              may contain metadata which describe the instantaneous magnifications and timescales of data.
              The expected data also include the output streams produced by services. These streams could, for instance,
              contain
              annotation data.

            <p>
              With respect to annotating video streams, one could make use of secondary video tracks with
              uniquely-identified
              bounding boxes or more intricate silhouettes defining spatial regions on which to attach semantic data, e.g.,
              metadata or annotations, using yet other secondary tracks. Similar approaches could work for point-cloud-based
              and
              mesh-based animations.

              Mixed-reality collaborative spaces enable users to visualize and interact with data and to work together from
              multiple locations on shared tasks and projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Digital microscopes could be accessed and utilized from mixed-reality collaborative spaces via WoT
              architecture and
              standards. Digital microscopes could be thusly utilized throughout biomedicine, the sciences, and education.
              Data from digital microscopes could be processed by services to produce outputs useful to users. Users could
              select
              and configure one or more such services and route streaming data or recordings through them to consume
              resultant
              data in a mixed-reality collaborative space. Graphs, or networks, of such services could be created by users.
              Services could also communicate back to digital microscopes to control their mechanisms and settings. Services
              which
              simultaneously process digital microscope data and communicate back to control such devices could be of use
              for
              providing users with automatic focusing, magnification, and tracking.
            </p>
            </p>
            Multimodal user interfaces could be dynamically generated for digital microscope content by making use of the
            output
            data provided by computer-vision-related services. Such dynamic multimodal user interfaces could provide users
            with
            the means of pointing and using spoken natural language to indicate precisely which contents that they wish to
            focus
            on, magnify, or track.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, a digital microscope could be magnifying and streaming 2D or 3D imagery of a living animal cell.
              This
              data could be processed by a service which provides computer-vision-related annotations, labeling parts of the
              cell:
              the cell nucleus, Golgi apparatus, ribosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and so forth. The
              resultant
              visual content with its algorithmically-generated annotations could then be interacted with by users. Users
              could
              point and use spoken natural language to indicate precisely which parts of the living animal cell that they
              wished
              for the digital microscope to focus on, magnify, or track.

          <dt>Security Considerations</dt>
          <dd>
            The streaming of digital microscope data should be securable for biomedical scenarios.
            Access to the controls and settings of digital microscopes should be securable for education scenarios so that
            teachers can adjust the controls and students cannot.

            <p>
              Requirements that are not addressed in the current WoT standards or building blocks include streaming
              protocols and
              formats for 3D digital microscope data and recordings. While digital microscopes could stream video using a
              variety
              of existing protocols and formats, the streaming of other forms of 3D data and animations, e.g., point clouds
              and
              meshes, could be facilitated by recommendation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Users could select and configure one or more services and route data streaming from digital microscopes
              through them
              to consume the resultant data in a mixed-reality collaborative space. Additionally, services could be designed
              to
              communicate back to and control the mechanisms and settings of digital microscopes.
              Requirements that are not addressed in the current WoT standards or building blocks include a means of
              interconnecting services. Perhaps services could utilize WoT architecture and could be described as WoT
              things, or
              virtual devices, which provide functionality including that with which to establish data connectivity between
              them.

            A smart grid integrates all players in the electricity market into one overall system through the
            interaction of generation, storage, grid management and consumption. Power and storage plants are already
            controlled today in such a way that only as much electricity is produced as is needed. Smart grids include
            consumers as well as small, decentralized energy suppliers and storage locations in this control system,
            so that on the one hand, consumption is more homogeneous in terms of time and space (see also intelligent
            electricity consumption) and on the other hand, in principle inhomogeneous producers (e.g. wind power) and
            consumers (e.g. lighting) can be better integrated.

            The term Smart Grid refers to the communicative networking and control of power generators, storage
            facilities, electrical consumers, and grid equipment in power transmission and distribution networks for
            electricity supply. This enables the optimization and monitoring of the interconnected components. The aim
            is to secure the energy supply on the basis of efficient and reliable system operation.

              <dd>
                While electricity grids with centralized power generation have dominated up to now, the trend is moving
                towards decentralized generation plants, both for generation from fossil primary energy through small
                CHP
                plants and for generation from renewable sources such as photovoltaic systems, solar thermal power
                plants,
                wind turbines and biogas plants. This leads to a much more complex structure, primarily in the area of
                load control, voltage maintenance in the distribution grid and maintenance of grid stability. In
                contrast
                to medium to large power plants, smaller, decentralized generation plants also feed directly into the
                lower voltage levels such as the low-voltage grid or the medium-voltage grid. This use case variants
                also
                includes operation and control of energy storages like batteries.

              <dd>
                A Virtual Power Plant (VPP) is an aggregation of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) that can act as an
                entity on energy markets or as an ancillary service to grid operation.
                The individual DERs often have a primary use on their own, with electric generation/consumption being a
                side-effect resp. secondary use. This results in negotiations/collaborations between many different
                parties e.g. such as the DER owner, the VPP operator, the grid operator and others.

              <dt>Smart Metering</dt>
              <dd>
                For consumers, a major change is the installation of smart meters. Their core tasks are remote reading
                and
                the possibility to realize fluctuating prices within a day at short notice. All electricity meters must
                therefore be replaced by those with remote data transmission.

            <ul>
              <li>Multi-Stakeholder Operation: Multiple involved parties have to find a common mode of operation</li>
              <li>Device Lifecycle Management: Since the VPP is a dynamic system of loosely coupled DERs, the
                appearance and disappearance of DERs as well as the software management on the devices itself requires
                a means to orchestrate the lifecycle of individual device's respective components.</li>
              <li>Embedded Runtime: Especially for DERs in remote locations, maintaining a close couple control loop
                can be expensive if feasible at all. Therefore, it is desirable to be able to offload control logic to
                the DER itself.</li>
              <li>Ensemble Discovery: In order to dynamically find matching DERs needed for the operational goal of a
                VPP, a registry with different options of DER discovery is needed.</li>
              <li>Content-Negotiation: The different stakeholders have to interact and therefore need a common data
                format.</li>
              <li>Resource Description: The DER has to describe itself to enable discovery of single DERs and
                ensembles, also the operational data needs to be understood by the different stakeholders without
                engineering effort.</li>
              <li>Push Services: As there is a fan-out with many devices that probably have a rate-limited connection
                connecting to one single command center, a bidirectional communication mechanism is needed rather than
                polling for the reverse direction</li>
              <li>Object Memory: As multiple and interchangeable stakeholders are involved in the application, a
                backlog of the object is beneficial for scrollkeeping</li>

          <dd>
            <ul>
              <li>Privacy: As fine-grained metering information provides sensitive data about a household, the system
                should show a high degree of privacy</li>
              <li>Trust: Since the data exchange between the virtual power plant and the distributed energy resource
                leads to a physical action that invokes high currents and monetary flows, the integrity of both
                parties and the exchange's data is crucial</li>
              <li>Layered L7 Communication: Since multiple different links are used for monitoring and control,
                integration requires a clear and consistent separation of information from the used serialization and
                application protocols to enable the exchange of homogenous information over heterogenous application
                layer protocols</li>

            User interface personalization is a task that most often needs to be repeated
            for all Devices a user wishes to interact with recurringly.
            With complex devices,
            this task can also be very time-consuming,
            which is problematic if the user regularly accesses similar,
            but not identical devices, as in the case of several cars rented over a month.

            A standardized set of personal information and preferences that could be used
            to configure personalizable devices automatically would be very helpful for all
            these cases in which the interaction becomes a customary practice.

            Basic in-car functionality is standardized to be managed by other devices.
            A user can control seat, radio or AC settings through a personalized multimodal interface
            shared by the car and their personal mobile device.
            User preferences are stored on the mobile Device (or in the cloud),
            and can be transferred across different car models handling a specific functionality
            (e.g. all cars with touchscreens should be able to adapt to a "high contrast" preference).

            The car can make itself available as a complex modality component that wraps around all
            functionality and supported modalities,
            or as a collection of modality components such as touchscreen, speech recognition system,
            or audio player.
            In the latter case,
            certain user preferences may be shared with other environments.

            For example,
            a user may opt to select the "high contrast" scheme at night on all of their displays,
            in the car or at home.
            A car that provides a set of modalities can be also adapted by the mobile device
            to compose an interface for its functionality,
            for example to manage playback of music tracks through the car's voice control system.
            Sensor data provided by the phone can be mixed with data recorded by the car's own sensors
            to profile user behavior which can be used as context in multimodal interaction.

            The method for controlling multiple devices in an orchestrated manner is dependent on the implementation of
            a client application in the current WoT specification. That is a reasonable design choice. However, the
            orchestrated control of multiple devices needs to be implemented by each client application even if the same
            control is done by multiple client applications.

          <dt>Motivation</dt>
          <dd>

            This use case motivates a standardized use of shared resources. One example is when a physical resource of
            the Thing should not be used by multiple Consumers at the same time like the arm of the robot but its
            position can be read my multiple Consumers.

          <dt>Expected Devices</dt>
          <dd>

            Concrete devices are irrelevant for this use case but devices with a physical state is required. However,
            we have currently the following devices that are connected to Raspberry Pis where the WoT stack (node-wot
            or similar) is running. Concrete device models can be given upon request.

            <ul>
              <li>Robotic arms</li>
              <li>Conveyor belts</li>
              <li>Motorized sliders where the robots or devices can be mounted on</li>
              <li>Philips Hue devices: Light bulbs, LED Strips, Motion sensors, Switch. We do not have the source code
                of these devices (brownfield) </li>
              <li>Various sensors (brightness, humidity, temperature, gyroscopic sensors)</li>
              <li>LED Screen to display messages</li>
            </ul>

            There are also IP Cameras but they are not WoT compatible and are not planned to be made compatible.

            We are offering a practical course for the students where they can interact fully remotely with WoT
            devices and verify their physical actions via video streams. We have sensors and actuators like robots.
            Students then build mashup applications to deepen their knowledge of WoT technologies. Official page of
            the course is <a

            However, there are cameras which can show humans entering the room as a side effect (they are meant to
            monitor the devices). The streams are accessible only to authorized users, the room has signs on the door
            and there is a cage around the area that is filmed.

            Discovery defines a distribution mechanism for the metadata contained in WoT Things Descriptions,
            and allows Things to advertise their capabilities and for potential consumers to find Things that
            match their needs. A standardized discovery mechanism is an enabler for convenient and ad-hoc
            orchestration of combinations of Things from different vendors while supporting appropriate security
            and privacy controls.

            A user wishing to build or instantiate an IoT service needs access to Thing Descriptions of installed and
            running
            devices satisfying specific requirements. These requirements can include being in or near a certain
            location,
            accessible using particular protocols or on a certain network,
            satisfying certain semantic categories, having certain capabilities, or having specific sub-APIs
            (interfaces).
            Discovery is the general process whereby WoT Thing Descriptions satisfying a specific set of such
            constraints are retrieved by a running system.

          <p>
          One of the most powerful features of the Web of Things is the ability for Thing Descriptions (TDs) to provide and
          abstract interface. This abstraction can remain constant when device capabilities change, when device suppliers
          are changed, or when new computational capabilities become available.
          </p><p>
          A "Virtual Thing" refers to a software simulation of a device conforming to a TD. That TD describes affordances
          generated in software from inputs that may or may not be similar to a physical thing that the same TD defines.
          </p><p>
          These inputs most often (but not always) will refer to data streams which, when examined with intelligent software
          (an AI), will allow that software to imitate the properties, actions, and events that an actual physical device
          would normally provide.
          </p>
          <div class="resize"><img src="./images/DataStreamToWoT.png" alt="Virtual Thing - Message Flow" /></div>
          <p>
          In a simple case, software could interpret data from a new door sensor product (possibly from a new manufacturer)
          and imitate the actions, properties, and events supported by the older device. This capability allows consuming
          software to remain unchanged and insulated from the churn caused by introducing new devices into the ecosystem.
          The consuming software will continue to use the original Thing Description as the interface definition.
          </p><p>
          In a more complex case, a data stream can be processed in software to imitate a physical device. Such "virtual
          things" allow the sensing hardware to be upgraded (in this case to video camera devices) without forcing a
          complete rewrite of software that was built to consume the original Thing Description. It is also possible for the
          data stream to be used to imitate multiple "virtual things", and also support new Thing Descriptions alongside the
          older ones.
          </p><p>
          Being able to use existing Thing Descriptions as an abstraction for "virtual things" will allow those with a
          device estate to save considerable time and effort in maintaining software and hardware in the estate.

            <p>
              A digital twin is the virtual representation of a physical asset such as a machine, a vehicle, robot,
              sensor.
              Using a digital twin allows businesses to analyze their physical assets to troubleshoot in real time,
              predict future problems, minimize downtime, and perform simulations to create new business opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              A digital twin may also be called a twin or a shadow. Digital twin technology may be referred to as device
              virtualization.
            </p>
            <p>
              Digital twins can be located in the edge or in the cloud.

            The user benefits from using digital twins with the following scenarios:

              <li>Better visibility: Continually view the operations of the machines or devices, and the status of

                modeling.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Documentation and communication: Use of the digital twin model helps to understand, document, and

                <p>
                  The virtual twin is a representation of a physical device or an asset. A virtual twin uses a model
                  that
                  contains observed and desired attribute values and also uses a semantic model of the behavior of the
                  device.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Intermittent connectivity: An application may not be able to connect to the physical asset. In such a
                  scenario, the application must be able to retrieve the last known status and to control the operation
                  states of other assets.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Protocol abstraction: Typically, devices use a variety of protocols and methods to connect to the IoT
                  network. From a users perspective this complexity should not affect other business applications such
                  as
                  an
                  enterprise resource planning (ERP) application.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Business rules: The user can specify the normal operating range of a property in a semantic model.
                  Business rules can be declaratively defined and actions can be automatically invoked in the edge or on
                  the
                  device.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Example: In a fleet of connected vehicles, the user monitors a collection of operating parameters,
                  such
                  as
                  fuel level, location, speed and others. The semantics-based virtual twin model enables the user to
                  decide
                  whether the operating parameters are in normal range. In out of range conditions the user can take
                  appropriate actions.

                <p>
                  In a predictive twin, the digital twin implementation builds an analytical or statistical model for
                  prediction by using a machine-learning technique. It need not involve the original designers of the
                  machine. It is different from the physics-based models that are static, complex, do not adapt to a
                  constantly changing environment, and can be created only by the original designers of the machine.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A data analyst can easily create a model based on external observation of a machine and can develop
                  multiple models based on the user’s needs.
                  The model considers the entire business scenario and generates contextual data for analysis and
                  prediction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the model detects a future problem or a future state of a machine, the user can prevent or
                  prepare
                  for them.
                  The user can use the predictive twin model to determine trends and patterns from the contextual
                  machine
                  data. The model helps to address business problems.

                <p>
                  In twin projections, the predictions and the insights integrate with back-end business applications,
                  making IoT an integral part of business processes.
                  When projections are integrated with a business process, they can trigger a remedial business
                  workflow.

                <p>
                  Prediction data offers insights into the operations of machines. Projecting these insights into the
                  back-end applications infrastructure enables business applications to interact with the IoT system and

          In smart city, home and industrial scenarios various devices are connected to a common network. These
          devices implement different protocols. To enable interoperability, an "agent" needs to communicate across
          different protocols. Platforms for this agent can be edge devices, gateways or cloud services.

          Interoperability across protocols is a must for all user scenarios that integrate devices from more than
          one protocol.

            There are multiple user scenarios that are addressed by this use case.

          <p>
            An example in the smart home environment is an automatic control lamps, air conditioners, heating, window
            blinds in a household
            based on sensor data, e.g. sunlight, human presence, calendar and clock, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            In an industrial environment individual actuators and production devices use different protocols.
            Examples include MQTT [[MQTT]], OPC UA [[OPC UA]], Modbus [[Modbus]], Fieldbus, and others.
            Gathering data from these devices, e.g. to support digital twins or big data use cases requires an "Agent"
            to bridge across these protocols.
            To provide interoperability and to reduce implementation complexity of this agent a common set of (minimum
            and maximum)
            requirements need to be supported by all interoperating devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            A smart city environment is similar to the industrial scenario in terms of device interoperability.
            Devices differ however,
            they include smart traffic lights, traffic monitoring, people counters, cameras.

            Recognizer system development has arrived at a point of maturity where
            if we want to dramatically enhance recognition performance,
            sensor fusion from multiple modalities is needed.
            In order to achieve this,
            an image recognizer should incorporate results coming from other
            kinds of recognizers (e.g. audio recognizer) within the network
            engaged in the same interaction cycle.

            An audio recognizer has been trained with the more common sounds in the house,
            in order to provide alerts in case of an emergency.
            In the same house a security system uses a video recognizer to identify people
            at the front door.
            These two systems need to cooperate with a remote home management system

            One of the main indicators concerning the usability of a system
            is the corresponding level of accessibility provided by it.
            The opportunity for all the users to receive and to deliver all kinds of information,
            regardless of the information format or the type of user profile,
            state or impairment is a recurrent need in web applications.
            One of the means to achieve accessibility is the design of a more
            synergic interaction based on the discovery of multimodal Modality Components.

            Synergy is two or more entities functioning together to produce a result
            that is not obtainable independently.
            It means "working together".
            For example,
            how to avoid disruptive interactions
            in nomadic systems (always affected by the changing context)
            is an important issue.
            In these applications,
            user interaction is difficult,
            distracted and less precise.
            Discovery and use of alternative input and output devices
            can increase synergic interaction offering new possibilities
            more adapted to the current context.
            Such a system can also enhance the fusion process for target groups of
            users experiencing permanent or temporary learning difficulties or with sensorial,
            emotional or social impairments.

            A person working mostly with a PC is having a problem with their right arm and hands.
            They are unable to use a mouse or a keyboard for a few months.
            They can point at things, sketch, clap, make gestures, but they can not make any precise movements.
            A generic interface allows this person to perform their most important tasks in their
            personal devices:
            to call someone, open a mailbox, access his agenda or navigate over some Web pages.
            The generic interface can propose child-oriented intuitive interfaces like a
            clapping-based interface,
            a very articulated TTS component, or reduced gesture input widgets.
            Other specialized devices might include phones with very big numbers,
            very simple remote controls,
            screens displaying text at high resolution,
            or voice command devices.

              Many of today's home IoT-enabled devices can provide similar functionality
              (e.g. audio/video playback),
              differing only in certain aspects of the user interface.
              This use case would allow continuous interaction with a specific
              application as the user moves from room to room,
              with the user interface switched automatically to the set of
              devices available in the user's present location.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand,
              some devices can have specific capabilities
              and user interfaces that can be used to add information to a larger context
              that can be reused by other applications and devices.
              This drives the need to spread an application across different devices
              to achieve a more user-adapted and meaningful interaction according to the
              context of use.
              Both aspects provide arguments for exploring use cases where
              applications use distributed multimodal interfaces.

            A home entertainment system is adapted by a mobile device
            as a set of user interface components.

            In addition to media rendering and playback,
            these Devices also act as input or output modalities for
            an application, for example an application running on a smartphone.
            The native user interface on the application
            does not have to be manipulated directly at all.
            A wall-mounted touch-sensitive TV could be used to navigate applications,
            and a wide-range microphone can handle speech input.
            Spatial (Kinect-style) gestures may also be used to control
            application behavior.

            Accessibility support software on the smartphone
            discovers available modalities and arranges them to best
            serve the user's purpose.
            One display can be used to show photos and movies,
            another for navigation.
            As the user walks into another room,
            this configuration is adapted dynamically to the new location.
            User intervention may be sometimes required to decide on
            the most convenient modality configuration.
            The state of the interaction is maintained
            while switching between modality sets.
            For example,
            if the user was navigating a GUI menu in the living room,
            it is carried over to another screen when they switch rooms,
            or replaced with a different modality such as voice
            if there are no displays in the new location.

              <li>Resource: a web resource </li>
              <li>Resource Server: the server where the resource is stored</li>
              <li>Resource Owner: the owner of a particular web resource. If it is a human is usually referred to as an
                end-user. More specifically from the RFC:
                <ul>
                  <li>An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>These actors can be mapped to WoT entities:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Client is a WoT Consumer</li>
              <li>Authorization Server is a third-party service</li>
              <li>Resource is an interaction affordance</li>
              <li>Resource Server is a Thing described by a Thing Description acting as a server.
                May be a device or a service.</li>
              <li>Resource Owner might be different in each use case.
                A Thing Description may also combine resources from different owners or web server.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>TO DO: Check the OAuth 2.0 spec to determine exactly how Resource Owner is defined.
              Is it the actual owner of the resource (e.g. running the web server) or simply someone
              with the rights to access that resource?</p>
            <p>The OAuth 2.0 protocol specifies an authorization layer that separates the client from the resource
              owner.
              The basic steps of this protocol are summarized in the following diagram:</p>

            <p>Steps A and B defines what is known as authorization grant type or flow.
              What is important to realize here is that not all of these interactions
              are meant to take place over a network protocol.
              In some cases,
              interaction with with a human through a user interface may be intended.

              OAuth2.0 defines 4 basic flows plus an extension mechanism.
              The most common of which are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>`code`</li>
              <li>`implicit`</li>
              <li>`password` (of resource owner)</li>
              <li>`client` (credentials of the client)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In addition, a particular extension which is of interest to IoT is the `device` flow.

              Further information about the OAuth 2.0 protocol can be found in
              <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1">IETF RFC6749</a>.
              In addition to the flows, OAuth 2.0 also supports scopes.
              Scopes are identifiers which can be attached to tokens.
              These can be used to limit authorizations to
              particular roles or actions in an API.
              Each token carries a set of scopes and these can be checked when an interaction
              is attempted and access can be denied if the token does not include a scope
              required by the interaction.

            To support OAuth 2.0, all devices must have the capability of:
            <ul>
              <li>Both the producer and consumer must be able to create and participate in a TLS connection.</li>
              <li>The producer must be able to verify an access (bearer) token (i.e. have sufficient computational
                power/connectivity). </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>Investigate whether DTLS can be used.
                Certainly the connection needs to be encrypted; this is required in the OAuth 2.0 specification.</li>
              <li>Investigate whether protocols other than HTTP can be used, e.g. CoAP.

            Depending on the OAuth 2.0 flow specified, various URLs and elements need to be specified,
            for example, the location of an authorization token server.
            OAuth 2.0 is also based on bearer tokens and so
            needs to include the same data as those, for example, expected encryption suite.
            Finally,
            OAuth 2.0 supports scopes so these need to be defined in the security scheme and specified in
            the form.

          <dd>

            A general use case for OAuth 2.0 is when a WoT consumer wants to access restricted interaction
            affordances.
            In particular, when those affordances have a specific resource owner which
            may grant some temporary permissions to the consumer.

            The WoT consumer can either be hosted in a remote device or interact directly with the end-user inside an
            application.

          </dd>
          <dt>Variants</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>For each OAuth 2.0 flow, there is a corresponding use case variant.
              We also include the experimental "device" flow for consideration.</p>

            <p><strong>code</strong></p>
            <p>A natural application of this protocol is when the end-user wants to interact directly with the consumed
              thing or to grant their authorization to a remote device. In fact from the <a
                href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1">RFC6749</a></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Since this is a redirection-based flow, the client must be capable of
                interacting with the resource owner's user-agent (typically a web
                browser) and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection)
                from the authorization server.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>This implies that the code flow can be only used when the resource owner interacts directly with the WoT
              consumer at least once. Typical scenarios are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>In a home automation context, a device owner uses a third party software to interact
                with/orchestrate one or more devices</li>
              <li>Similarly, in a smart farm, the device owner might delegate its authorization to third party
                services.</li>
              <li>In a smart home scenario, Thing Description Directories might be deployed using this authorization
                mechanism. In particular, the list of the registered TDs might require an explicit read authorization
                request to the device owner (i.e. an human who has bought the device and installed it). </li>
              <li>... </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The following diagram shows the steps of the protocol adapted to WoT idioms and entities. In this
              scenario, the WoT Consumer has read the Thing Description of a Remote Device and want to access one of its
              WoT Affordances protected with OAuth 2.0 code flow.</p>

            <p><strong>device</strong></p>
            <p>The device flow (IETF <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628">RFC 8628</a>) is a variant of the
              code
              flow for browserless and
              input-constrained devices. Similarly, to its <i>parent</i> flow, it requires a close interaction between
              the
              resource owner and the WoT consumer. Therefore, the use cases for this flow are the same as the code
              authorization grant but restricted to all devices that do not have a rich means to interact with the
              resource owner. However, differently from `code`, RFC 8628 states explicitly that one of the actors of
              the protocol is an <b>end-user</b> interacting with a <b>browser</b> (even if <a

                  <li>Due to the polling nature of this protocol (as specified in Section 3.4), care is needed to avoid

                    the
                    client should only commence a device authorization request when <b>prompted by the user and not

            <p><strong>client credential</strong></p>
            <p>The Client Credentials grant type is used by clients to obtain an access token outside of the context of

              <li>The client can request an access token using only its client
                credentials (or other supported means of authentication) when

                control, or <b>those of another resource owner that has been previously
                  arranged with the authorization server</b> (the method of which is beyond
                the scope of this specification).</li>

            <p>Therefore the client credential grant can be used:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>When the resource owner is a public authority. For example, in a smart city context, the authority
                provides a web service where to register an application id.</li>
              <li>Companion application</li>
              <li>Industrial IoT. Consider a smart factory where the devices or services are provisioned with client
                credentials. </li>
              <li>...</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The Client Credentials flow is illustrated in the following diagram. Notice how the Resource Owner is not

            <p>Comment: Usually client credentials are distributed using an external service which is used by humans to
              register a particular application. For example, the `npm` cli has a companion dashboard where a developer
              requests the generation of a token that is then passed to the cli. The token is used to verify the
              publishing process of `npm` packages in the registry. Further examples are Docker cli and OpenId Connect
              Client Credentials.</p>

                Security Best Current Practice</a>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In order to avoid these issues, clients should not use the implicit
                grant (response type "token") or other response types issuing access
                tokens in the authorization response, unless access token injection
                in the authorization, response is prevented and the aforementioned
                token leakage vectors are mitigated.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The RFC above suggests using `code` flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) instead.</p>
            <p>The implicit flow was designed for public clients typically implemented inside a browser (i.e. javascript
              clients). As the `code` is a redirection-based flow and it requires direct interaction with the resource's
              owner user-agent. However, it requires one less step to obtain a token as it is returned directly in the
              authentication request (see the diagram below).</p>
            <p>Considering the WoT context this flow is not particularly different from `code` grant and it can be used
              in the same scenarios.</p>
            <p>Comment: even if the `implicit` flow is deprecated existing services may still using it.</p>

              <li>The user can travel around a real space with guidance from virtually defined geospatial
                data projected on a head-mounted wearable display synchronized with the view of the physical
                environment.</li>
              <li>The wearable display can generate position and orientation (geopose) data so that the user's
                movement will be traced through the physical environment and can synchronized with virtual features.
              </li>
              <li>The user can control the video images provided by the system, based
                sensors attached the display system or other means of control (gestures, voice input, etc.)</li>
              <li>The technology should include synchronization of playback of stored video media and related
                sensors, displays, and devices as well as the display of geolocation information from the virtual map.
              </li>
              <li>Discovery of sensors should take into account the position and field of view of the user
                so that data can be retrieved only for the relevant features of interest.</li>
              <li>Discovery may additionally want to consider the motion (e.g. velocity) of the user to that
                data soon to come into view can be prefetched.</li>
              <li>Metadata for sensors needs to distinguish between the location of the device itself and the
                feature of interest it is measuring. For example, a camera might monitor traffic on a highway.
                The feature of interest is the location on the highway being monitored, while the location of the
                camera might be quite far away (e.g. mounted on top of a building).</li>

              <li>Two synchronized displays (for example, a phone and a headset) can offer greater insight and provide
                clearer
                guidance to the user by showing different views of the same location, e.g. a top-view map on the phone.
              </li>
              <li>A VR (virtual-only) implementation may also be used, with a rendered scene replacing the real scene.
                This may be applicable to contexts such as a Smart City dashboard where sensor information from data
                needs to be viewed in context without having to actually visit the site.</li>
              <li>The head-mounted semi-transparent display might be replaced in some contexts with a handheld display
                e.g. a phone or tablet. To be useful for AR however, such a device needs a back camera to simulate
                transparency
                and capture images of the real environment (optional for VR), and a way to determine its geolocation and
                orientation (geopose) relative to the environment.</li>
              <li>The head-mounted display may use a camera rather than being physically transparent.</li>
              <li>A microphone may be added for voice input, including voice commands. This avoid having to clutter the
                view with controls.</li>
              <li>A 3D camera (e.g. LIDAR) may be used to capture a view of the environment, which can be helpful to
                establish geopose and align annotations with real features of the environment.</li>
              <li>A virtual guide for a particular geographic location, e.g. a historical site, which visualises past
                events and buildings in AR, or allows remote users to explore in VR.</li>
              <li>A medical tool which allows a patient to describe their symptoms using AR, e.g. identify a painful
                area
                on their own body, which is also modelled as a 'map' to show internal features and display a treatment
                guide, including any WoT medical devices.</li>
              <li>A virtual controller for a city engineer to visualize utilities, e.g. electrical cables or water
                pipes,
                and control them. For example, a maintenance engineer could switch off an individual street lamp in
                order
                to replace the bulb using an AR menu displayed on that WoT-enabled lamppost.</li>
              <li>These mechanisms can also be used for video overlay in general. The technologies are related
                to the recording, playing, and distribution of video content when the data is stored.
                Playback of stored data and movements would be useful for simulation and debugging.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>If an AR systems is compromised it could be used to guide a user into a dangerous
                situation while hiding that fact from them, e.g. encouraging them to step over a drop.</li>
              <li>For the above reason the system should "fail gracefully" if there is any sign its integrity is
                compromised, and should implement mechanisms (e.g. signing) to detect tampering.
                Standards should be similar to other systems than can cause physical harm, e.g. automobiles.</li>
              <li>For a "simulated" transparent head-mounted display using a camera, the system should
                have a fail-safe supporting an unfiltered view, which should be automatic even if the processor
                crashes.</li>
              <li>For all systems the user should have a simple
                way (e.g. a single button push) of viewing "baseline reality".</li>

                needs to take the velocity and last known position of the data source into account and compute
                a zone of uncertainty and return the metadata for sources that might possibly be in the field of view.
                For sources such as this with dynamic positions, the AR system may also communicate with data sources
                directly to determine their most recent geolocation.

        <dd>

          <ul>
            <li>IoT devices are often designed to be inexpensive (so they can be used at scale),
              small (for ease of installation) and are often power-limited, for example needing to
              run off a battery. For all these reasons, they usually have severely limited on-board
              computational capabilities.</li>
            <li>For applications that require significant computation and/or memory, for example
              computer vision, machine learning, or autonomous navigation, offloading work to
              another computer on the network may be advantageous.</li>
            <li>Offloading to the cloud typically involves relatively long latencies and may also
              have privacy implications. Edge computing implies offloading to a more "local" compute
              node with lower latency and optionally under more direct control of the user (improving
              privacy). This can be important for control applications (e.g. in robotics), computer
              graphics (e.g. gaming) and for applications processing imagery (e.g. facial recognition).</li>
            <li>An edge computer is also a convenient place to run persistent computations such as
              IoT orchestration rules that need to be "always on". Such an IoT orchestration system,
              in addition to needing to read from sensors and send commands to actuators over the
              network, may also invoke computationally-intensive services (e.g. image recognition). An
              example would be a security system that when a motion sensor is tripped, runs a person
              detection computation, and if a person is detected when and where they should not be,
              sounds an alarm. The motion sensor and alarm can be IoT devices while the person
              detection is a computationally-intensive service.</li>

          The WoT architecture can provide an interesting approach to edge computing:
          <ul>
            <li>An IoT orchestration running in an edge computer can consume WoT Thing Descriptions
              in order to determine how to connect to IoT devices.</li>
            <li>Fixed services (e.g. person detection) and generic compute nodes (a service that would
              allow an arbitrary computation to be loaded onto it) can also advertise themselves using
              Thing Descriptions, allowing an IoT orchestrator to interface to devices and services
              in a uniform way. This also facilitates support for "virtual devices", e.g. using
              computer vision, audio recognition, or other forms of analytics in place of a physical sensor.</li>
            <li>WoT discovery can be used to find appropriate compute services for IoT devices to offload
              computationally demanding tasks to, assuming those services describe themselves with
              TDs and advertise their availability via WoT discovery mechanisms.</li>

              (e.g. object detection and tracking, person detection, etc.). General-purpose computation
              is more powerful but also is more difficult to make fully secure.</li>
            <li>An edge computation can be stateless (function as a service, FaaS) or stateful. It is easier
              to migrate stateless computations transparently to new compute hardware but state then
              needs to be provided by a separate service, e.g. a database, and it is harder to program.</li>
            <li>Edge computers may provide just IoT orchestration without significant computational
              ability, just compute offload, or both. Many more use cases can be unlocked by providing both.</li>
            <li>Persistent computation can be provided in various ways. Rather than actually running
              continuously, an edge computation might be event-driven, for example.</li>

          Edge compute services supporting the specification of generic computation has many security
          challenges. In addition to the challenges common to cloud computing, e.g. protecting "tenants"
          from seeing each other's activity, additional challenges arise if the edge computer is offering
          computation as an ad-hoc service. For example, there needs to be a way to project the edge
          computer from denial-of-service attacks.

          An edge computer may also need to be protected from physical attacks. There is also the
          possibility that an edge computer might be physically compromised so approaches such as
          isolated containers (protecting the contents from the edge computer's hypervisor), and/or
          validated boot, might be necessary in some circumstances.

        </dd>
        <dt>Privacy Considerations</dt>

        <dd>

          Edge computers can theoretically improve privacy since sensitive data can be processed "locally"
          without having to be transmitted to a remote site. This however is tempered by edge computer's
          greater vulnerability to physical attacks. To avoid offloading work to a malicious edge computer,
          some means of evaluating the trustworthiness of edge computers is needed.

      <h2>User Stories</h2>
      <p>User stories provide a high-level summary of a requirement in the form of
      a single sentence that describes a stakeholder (Who has the need),
      a technical requirement (What they need; a capability or condition; features),
      and a functional requirement (Why they need it; the purpose or motivation; use cases).
      These are often stated in the form of a sentence: "As a <em>Who</em> I need <em>What</em> so that I can <em>Why</em>."
      For clarity, the following user stories break out each part in a list.
      Each user story will in addition identify one or more Use Case (or Use Case Categories)
      that establishes the motivation for the identified capability.
      Capabilities correspond to sets of features in other technical specifications.

      <p class="ednote">Define how user stories and features are linked.  We can link back from 
      implemented features to user stories, but want to avoid unstable links e.g. to documents
      maintained in github.  If we have bidirectional links we need some mechanism to keep them
      consistent.</p>

      <h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
      <p class="ednote">We will keep this and following subsection for now but should consider reorganizing them into user stories.</p>
      <p>This section defines the properties required in an
        abstract Web of Things (WoT) architecture.</p>

      <section id="sec-requirements-principles">
        <h3>Common Principles</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>WoT architecture should enable mutual
            interworking of different eco-systems using web
            technology.</li>
          <li>WoT architecture should be based on the web
            architecture using RESTful APIs.</li>
          <li>WoT architecture should allow to use
            multiple payload formats which are commonly used
            in the web.</li>
          <li>WoT architecture must enable different device
            architectures and must not force a client or server
            implementation of system components.</li>
          <li>Flexibility
            <p>There are a wide variety of physical
              device configurations for WoT
              implementations. The WoT abstract
              architecture should be able to be mapped to
              and cover all of the variations.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Compatibility
            <p>There are already many existing IoT
              solutions and ongoing IoT standardization
              activities in many business fields. The WoT
              should provide a bridge between these
              existing and developing IoT solutions and
              Web technology based on WoT concepts. The
              WoT should be upwards compatible with
              existing IoT solutions and current
              standards.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Scalability
            <p>WoT must be able to scale for IoT
              solutions that incorporate thousands to
              millions of devices. These devices may offer
              the same capabilities even though they are
              created by different manufacturers.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Interoperability
            <p>WoT must provide interoperability across
              device and cloud manufacturers. It must be
              possible to take a WoT enabled device and
              connect it with a cloud service from
              different manufacturers out of the box.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

                changes of the thing's status
                information.</li>
              <li>invoking functions with input and
                output parameters which would cause
                certain actuation or calculation.</li>
              <li>subscribing to, receiving and
                unsubscribing to event notifications
                that are more general than just reports
                of state transitions.

            search of things providing required

            variety of thing capabilities such as edge
            devices with resource restrictions and virtual
            things on the cloud, based on the same model.</li>
          <li>WoT architecture should support multiple
            levels of thing hierarchy with intermediate
            entities such as gateways and proxies.</li>
          <li>WoT architecture should support accessing
            things in the local network from the outside of
            the local network (the internet or another local
            network), considering network address
            translation.</li>

      <section id="sec-requirements-application">
        <h3>Application</h3>

      <section id="sec-requirements-legacy-adoption">
        <h3>Legacy Adoption</h3>

          <li>WoT architecture should allow mapping of
            legacy IP and non-IP protocols to web protocols,
            supporting various topologies, where
            such legacy protocols are terminated and
            translated.
          </li>
          <li>WoT architecture should allow transparent
            use of existing IP protocols without
            translation, which follow RESTful architecture.</li>

          <li>WoT architecture must not enforce client or server
            roles on devices and services.
            An IoT device can be either a client or a server,
            or both, depending on the system architecture;
            the same is true of edge and cloud services.

      <h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        The W3C WoT Thing Architecture [[wot-architecture]] defines the
        abstract architecture of Web of Things and illustrates it with various
        system topologies. This section describes
        technical requirements derived from the abstract
        architecture.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Components in the Web of Things and the Web
          of Things Architecture</h3>
        <p>The use cases help to identify basic components
          such as devices and applications, that access and
          control those devices, proxies (i.e., gateways and
          edge devices) that are located between devices.
          An additional component useful in some use cases
          is the directory, which assists with discovery.</p>
        <p>Those components are connected to the internet or
          field networks in offices, factories or other
          facilities. Note that all components involved may be
          connected to a single network in some cases,
          however, in general components can be deployed
          across multiple networks.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Devices</h3>
        <p>
          Access to devices is made using a description of
          their functions and interfaces. This description is
          called <em>Thing Description (TD)</em>. A <em>Thing
            Description</em> includes a general metadata about
          the device, information models representing
          functions, transport protocol description for
          operating on information models, and security
          information.
        </p>
        <p>General metadata contains device identifiers
          (URI), device information such as serial number,
          production date, location and other human readable
          information.</p>
        <p>Information models defines device attributes, and
          represent device’s internal settings, control
          functionality and notification functionality.
          Devices that have the same functionality have the
          same information model regardless of the transport
          protocols used.</p>
        <p>Because many systems based on Web of Things
          architecture are crossing system Domains,
          vocabularies and meta data (e.g. ontologies) used in
          information models should be commonly understood by
          involved parties. In addition to REST transports,
          PubSub transports are also supported.</p>
        <p>Security information includes descriptions about
          authentication, authorization and secure
          communications. Devices are required to put TDs
          either inside them or at locations external to the
          devices, and to make TDs accessible so that other
          components can find and access them.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Applications</h3>
        <p>Applications need to be able to generate and use network
          and program interfaces based on metadata (descriptions).</p>
        <p>Applications have to be able to obtain these
          descriptions through the network,
          therefore, need to be able to conduct search
          operations and acquire the necessary descriptions over the
          network.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Digital Twins</h3>
        <p>Digital Twins need to generate program interfaces
          internally based on metadata (descriptions),
          and to represent virtual devices by using those
          program interfaces. A twin has to produce a description for
          the virtual device and make it externally available.</p>
        <p>Identifiers of virtual devices need to be newly
          assigned, therefore, are different from the original
          devices. This makes sure that virtual devices and
          the original devices are clearly recognized as
          separate entities. Transport and security mechanisms
          and settings of the virtual devices can be different
          from original devices if necessary. Virtual devices
          are required to have descriptions provided either directly by
          the twin or to have them available at external
          locations. In either case it is required to make the
          descriptions available so that other components can find and
          use the devices associated with them.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Discovery</h3>
        <p>For TDs of devices and virtual devices to be
          accessible from devices, applications and twins,
          there needs to be a common way to share TDs.
          Directories can serve this requirement by providing
          functionalities to allow devices and twins
          themselves automatically or the users to manually
          register the descriptions.</p>
        <p>Descriptions of the devices and virtual devices
          need to be searchable by external entities.
          Directories have to be able to process search
          operations with search keys such as keywords from
          the general description in the device description or
          information models.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Security</h3>
<!--
        <p>Security information related to devices and
          virtual devices needs to be described in device
          descriptions. This includes information for
          authentication/authorization and payload
          encryption.</p>
        <p>WoT architecture should support multiple security
          mechanism commonly used in the web, such as Basic,
          Digest, Bearer and OAuth2.0.</p>

        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>The Web of Things primarily targets
          machine-to-machine communication. The humans
          involved are usually developers that integrate
          Things into applications. End-users will be faced
          with the front-ends of the applications or the
          physical user interfaces provided by devices
          themselves. Both are out of scope of the W3C WoT
          specifications. Given the focus on IoT instead of
          users, accessibility is not a direct requirement,
          and hence is not addressed within this specification.</p>
        <p>There is, however, an interesting aspect on
          accessibility: Fulfilling the requirements above
          enables machines to understand the network-facing
          API of devices. This can be utilized by
          accessibility tools to provide user interfaces of
          different modality, thereby removing barriers to
          using physical devices and IoT-related applications.</p>

          We are standardizing the ECHONET Lite and promoting the spread of smart homes
          with support for commercialization of devices which support the ECHONET Lite standards
          and cooperation with related industries. We also develop guidelines for ECHONET Lite Web API
          which can be used to access ECHONET Lite devices via a Web server with RESTful Web API.</p>

        <p>At the PlugFest in October 2021, WoT consumers connected to ECHONET Lite Web API devices
          via an intermediary, which translates HTTP message format. We think that it is desirable
          for WoT specification to support transparent interconnection between a WoT consumer and
          non-WoT devices that use HTTP protocol as a transport protocol, including ECHONET Lite Web API devices.
          We hope that WoT WG would investigate a solution for it.</p>

      <p>
        Such a binding needs an own set of OPC UA specific vocabulary definitions

      <p>
        The EdgeX Foundry [EDGEX] is a community-driven project,
        organized under the Linux Foundation, to define
        a reference software architecture for IoT hubs.
        Its goal is to enable interoperability
        by combining a set of key IoT services with a set of interfaces to a variety
        of IoT device protocols and ecosystems.
        There is a reference implementation of the EdgeX architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        The EdgeX Foundry reference architecture provides a set of protocol translation services and exposes
        interfaces to a variety of ecosystems and devices.  However, it currently
        lacks a standard and IoT-appropriate metadata standard to describe the device interfaces
        (and the data models for those interfaces) that it exposes on the network.
        The WoT Thing Description could fulfill this role; otherwise, the EdgeX Foundry
        architecture fits within the general framework of a WoT system.
