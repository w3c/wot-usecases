Any other topics for today?

## Logistics
As already approved last week:

* Holidays - Use Cases call to be cancelled
    * Mar-20 Vernal Equinox Holiday in Japan
    * Apr-10 Right after the AC Meeting 2024 in Hiroshima
* Daylight Saving change has just started!
    * US Daylight Saving starts on March 10.
        * WoT Use Cases call is allocated based on the US Eastern time.
        * So the start time will become one hour ealier (noon CET) after March 10 in Europe/Japan.
        * No change in US/Canada.
    * European Summertime starts on March 31.
        * So the start time will be back to the original time (1pm CEST) in Europe after March 31.
        * No change in US/Japan.

## Updated Plan
### Proposed plan on 6 March 2024
* Mar-13 and 27: Fix basic template for Functional Requirements based on a concrete eample
* Apr-3 and 17: Fix basic template for Technical Rquirements based on a concrete example

### Proposed Updated Plan on 13 March 2024
* Mar-13: Fix basic template for Use Cases based on the discussion on 6 March
* Mar-27 and Apr-3: Fix basic template for Functional Requirements based on a concrete eample
* Apr-17 and Apr-28: Fix basic template for Technical Requirements based on a concrete example

#### Question:
* Any objetions to approve the updated plan?

**TODO:** We need to consider:
* Note publication schedule, i.e., "September, 2024" as the publication date for the WoT Use Cases and Requirements Note"
    * See also: [schedule.md](https://github.com/w3c/wot/blob/e10b7b772f4b5550c4d5891345728600a359e58a/planning/schedule.md)
* Relationship with the existing discussion on the "work items" by the other TFs
    * See also:
       * [Security](https://github.com/w3c/wot/tree/main/planning/Security)
       * [Discovery](https://github.com/w3c/wot/blob/main/planning/Discovery/work-items.md)
       * [Thing Description](https://github.com/w3c/wot/blob/main/planning/ThingDescription/work-items.md)

## Minutes review and discussion points

### Minutes

[Mar-06 minutes](https://www.w3.org/2024/03/06-wot-uc-minutes.html)

### Discussion points

* Confirmed logistics: Cancellations, Daylight Saving Changes
* Confirmed updated Plan on March 6
* Use Case Template based on [the example of smart home](https://w3c.github.io/wot-usecases/#UC-leaving-and-coming-home-1)
    * Motivation
    * Stakeholders and Environments
        * Add "Expected protocol" also under "Expectations for stakeholders and environments"
    * Gaps: Need to clarify the meaning of "Gap" here
        * difference with existing standards, similar use cases and dependencies
             * part of "Gaps"? or separate items?
    * How to handle the proposals from other TF members?
    * Action: Mizushima create a PR to update the use case template based on UseCase discussion

#### Question:
* Any objections to approve the minutes and the discussion points above?

## Use Case template
Continue discussion on the Use Case template based on the call on Mar-6 using a concrete template.

For that purpose, we need to clarify What we mean by "Gaps":
1. gaps between ***the user's need*** and ***what's possible today***
2. relationships between:
    * the proposed use case and existing use cases
    * the proposed use case and (1) existing WoT specifications, (2) other W3C specifications and (3) other SDOs' standards

I agree with [Ege's PR 277](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/pull/277), and would suggest we describe the two items above separately within the template.

Let's have some more discussion based on the [concrete template Markdown](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/USE-CASES/example-template.md).

---
After fixing the Use Case Template, let's have discussion on the template for Functional Requirements (next week).

### Summary
* Important feedback
    * Got various insights from important stakeholders based on their experiences about authentication/verification for a complicated IoT environment with multiple users, multiple devices and multiple services.
    * Various kinds of authentications for devices, services and users are required. In addition, considering how to interconnect all the related authentication mechanisms and authentication results is important within acutal/complicated IoT system.
    * Privacy protection and trust of data/devices are also important.
    * Also we should think about how to run the expected/complicated IoT system which includes various sub-systems, multiple users and devices.
    * For that purpose, how to apply the existing standards and authentication mechanisms for actual systems is a big challenge. Also what WoT should do within that context is another big challenge.
* Next steps
    * Bringing the important feedback to the WoT IG as concrete use cases and requirements
    * If there is any impact to the Use Case Template, we should apply that to the template now (or later).
    * In parallel, the WoT JP CG will continue its regular events on WoT incuding possible Ideathon to extarct concrete use cases based on the feedback from the seminar.
