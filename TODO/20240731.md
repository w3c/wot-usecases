[July-17 minutes](https://www.w3.org/2024/07/17-wot-uc-minutes.html)

## Fix the YAML-based Use Case template
* Issues and PRs
    * [Change the order of items of WoT-UseCases-Template.yml #298](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/pull/298)
        * [Change the order of items of sample-usecase-template.yml based Issue â€¦ #293](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/pull/293) was closed.
            * Because "sample-usecase-template.yml" was removed.
            * Then this PR is recreated using WoT-UseCases-Template.yml.
* How to manage Real names and e-mail addresses
    * previous discussion
       * The Authorship and the tight to delete
         * if we can't contact submitters in the future (somehow - may or may not be email) then we reserve the right to delete a use case.
         * We should have clear "authorship" for uses cases.
         * We should don't allow anonymous use cases.
      * We need a policy proposal.
      * We should clarify the policy before publication.
    * ["Submitter" should indicate Real Name(s) - #286](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/286)
    * [Form template Updates - PR #285](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/pull/285)
* Security, Privacy and Stakeholders
    * [Security and Privacy Categories - #290](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/290) 
* What is Gaps
    * It is difficult to understand the difference between "Why WoT?" and "Gaps" in Use Cases Issue Template.
    * [How to deal with gap analysis? Need clear definition for "gap analysis" #267](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/267)
    * [The structure/category of the use case description #268](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/268)
* To add explanatory text for each question item
    * There are not enough information for each question items for stakeholders to write.
    * Therefore, explanatory text for each question item should be added in the Use Cases Issue Template.

## Internal Trial
* [Historical Data #296](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/296)
    * See also a Ege's comment of [Template Updates #295](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/pull/295).
* [[TEST] Smart home: Leaving and Coming Home](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/299)

## Refactoring
* When will use cases be collected?
    * Current issues
        * Plans to collect use cases are significantly delayed
        * Use cases should be collected as soon as possible.
        * If use cases are delayed to collect, it will affect the writing of WoT WG/IG.
        * Unless YAML-based issue template is fixed, it is hard to discuss functional and technical requirements.
        * To do one trial run ourselves before involving external parties. 
   * Proposal
      * There are three types of submitters.
         * Type1. WoT WG/IG members
            * Type2. People who have been asked to submit Use Case by WoT WG/IG members
            * Type3. Other (i.e. People who WoT WG/IG members don't know)
         * Fix the YAML-based issue template as quickly as possible
            * The complete YAML-based issue template is required for Type3.
            * If they have questions, they can not ask us them easily.
            * we have to create the compleate YAML-based issue templat for them
            * After it is fixed, we start to cllect use cases from Type3.
         * In parallel, we will start collecting use cases from Type1 and Type2 using current template.
            * Question items are fixed.
            * If they have questions, they ask us them easily.
* When will discussions of functional requirements and technical requirements be started?
   * Clarify what functional requirements are and what technical requirements are.
   * Clarify differences between functional requirements and technical requirements.
      * These should be describe in Use Cases and Requirements note.
   * How are a functional requirements template and a technical requirements template described?
      * For discussion, we need drafts of a functional requirements template and a technical requirements template.
* The Structure of Use Cases and Requiremnts note
    * How to use [previos Use Cases and Requiremnts note](https://w3c.github.io/wot-usecases/)
      1. Add new use cases and new requirements into previos Use Cases and Requiremnts note
      1. Refactor using new use cases, new requirements and previos Use Cases and Requiremnts note
      1. create new Use Cases and Requiremnts note without previos Use Cases and Requiremnts note
* Publication Schedules
    * If publicate Use Cases and Requirements note, it needs some use cases at least.
