    1. Mizushima showed the updated Use Case Template which includes all the proposed changes discussed during the previous call on Mar-13
        * added links of the existing questionnaires to the wide review section

    1. Preliminary resolution confirmed to use the [example Use Case description](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/USE-CASES/example-template.md) as the basis of the updated template
    1. Actions:
        * Mizushima sends out a confirmation message to the whole WoT WG to make actual resolution (mainly would get McCool's confirmation)
        * Mizushima creates an actual Use Cases Template without content based on the [example Use Case description](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/USE-CASES/example-template.md)
    1. Identifid the need to describe the Gaps in detail for the requirements descripton

Any objections to the minutes and the discussion points above?

## Finalizing the Use Case Template
### Basic template
* [Use Case Template without content](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/USE-CASES/use-case-template-2024.md)
    * Actual resolution to use the above template based on the [Call-for-Resolution message](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wot-ig/2024Mar/0019.html)

### Further questions
* How to apply existing guidelines within the [old template](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/USE-CASES/use-case-template.md)?
* How to describe the whole guidance on Use Case submission on [README.md](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/USE-CASES/README.md)?

* Proposal
    * [README.md](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/USE-CASES/README.md) describes basic flow about use case generation.
    * [Use Case Template](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/USE-CASES/use-case-template-2024.md) describes detailed note on each item.

* As the resource to have discussion, I've generated a Pullreuest on slighytly updated README.md.
    * [PR #280 - updated README.md](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/pull/280)
* And would like to have discussion about how to apply Lagally's guides to the Use Case template.
