## Minutes review and discussion points

### Minutes

[May-8 minutes](https://www.w3.org/2024/05/08-wot-uc-minutes.html)

### Discussion points
* Github issue template using YAML
    1. confirmed [the YAML-based template](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/subsection-test.yml) includes all the content from [the MD-based template](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/USE-CASES/use-case-template-2024.md).
    2. additional notes from [old template](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/USE-CASES/use-case-template.md) are also included in YAML-based template. 
    3. further improvement for the YAML template to be done using GitHub Issues and PRs
* Question about the need for submitter's email address (discussion to be continued)
    * RESOLUTION: While not required for submission of a use case for consideration, the email of the submitter should be requested and recorded before a use case is published in case followup is necessary. These emails will be kept private and only used for communication on the use case.

Any objections?

## Fix the YAML-based Use Case template

* Issues and PRs
    * Closed Issued
        * [Mention Possibility of External Submissions via Issues - #281](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/281) is closed.
    * Editorial Issues and PRs
        * [Typos - #288](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/288)
            * [Fix typos pointed out by Issue 288 - #292](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/pull/292)
        * [Stakeholders - #289](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/289)
            * [Use a dropdown for the stakeholders - #291](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/pull/291)
                * See also [New Use Case with dropdown](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/new?assignees=&labels=UC&projects=&template=sample-usecase-template.yml&title=Add+new+use+case%3A+%3Ctitle%3E)
    * Need discussion
        * ["Submitter" should indicate Real Name(s) - #286](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/286)
        * ["What to be done?" is ambiguous - #287](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/287)
        * [Form template Updates - PR #285](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/pull/285)
            * mainly problem on how to handle submitter's email address as contact information
            * several possible options:
                * opt1. no need for email address but simply use the GitHub account to contact the submitter
                * opt2. ask the submitter to put email address as an optional item
                * opt3. ask the submitter to send their email address to team-wot to start the review procedure
                * opt4. any other ideas?
            * In any case, need to clarify what to be done how as a note explicitly. 
        * [Security and Privacy Categories - #290](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/290) 

**NOTE:**
To avoid potential conflicts and make the discussion easier:
* It would be better to generate PRs on editorial problems and PRs on normative problems separately.
* Also it would be better to raise an Issue and/or a PR separately for each form item one by one.

## Functional Requirements
What kind of functionality is needed to implement the proposed use cases.

**NOTE:** We need to consider:
* Publication schedule, i.e., "September, 2024" as the publication date for the WoT Use Cases and Requirements Note"
    * We'll discuss basic publication schedule during today's call later.
* Relationship with the existing discussion on the "work items" by the other TFs
    * We'll start discussion on Fuctional Requirements during today's call later.

## Technical Requirements
What kind of feature is needed (=to be added or improved) for each WoT specification, i.e., WoT Thing Description and WoT Discovery.
