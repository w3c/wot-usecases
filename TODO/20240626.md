## Reorganize meeting plans (When use cases are started to collect?)
* Current issues
    * We need to reorganize meeting plans. Because Use Cases Call had cancelled for 5 weeks.
    * Plans to collect use cases are significantly delayed
    * Use cases should be collected as soon as possible.
    * If use cases are delayed to collect, it will affect the writing of WoT WG/IG.
    * Unless YAML-based issue template is fixed, it is hard to discuss functional and technical requirements.

* Proposal
    * There are three types of submitters.
       * Type1. WoT WG/IG members
       * Type2. People who have been asked to submit Use Case by WoT WG/IG members
       * Type3. Other (i.e. People who WoT WG/IG members don't know)
    * Fix the YAML-based issue template as quickly as possible
       * The complete YAML-based issue template is required for Type3.
          * If they have questions, they can not ask us them easily.
          * we have to create the compleate YAML-based issue templat for them
       * After it is fixed, we start to cllect use cases from Type3.
    * In parallel, we will start collecting use cases from Type1 and Type2 using current template.
        * Question items are fixed.
        * If they have questions, they ask us them easily.

## Fix the YAML-based Use Case template

* Issues and PRs
    * Editorial Issues and PRs
        * Close
            * [Typos - #288](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/288)
        * [Stakeholders - #289](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/289)
            * [Use a dropdown for the stakeholders - #291](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/pull/291)
                * See also [New Use Case with dropdown](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/new?assignees=&labels=UC&projects=&template=sample-usecase-template.yml&title=Add+new+use+case%3A+%3Ctitle%3E)
                * [Use a checklist for the stakeholders #291](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/pull/291)
    * Need discussion
        * ["Submitter" should indicate Real Name(s) - #286](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/286)
        * ["What to be done?" is ambiguous - #287](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/287)
            * [Change the order of items of sample-usecase-template.yml based Issue â€¦ #293](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/pull/293)
        * [Form template Updates - PR #285](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/pull/285)
            * mainly problem on how to handle submitter's email address as contact information
            * several possible options:
                * opt1. no need for email address but simply use the GitHub account to contact the submitter
                * opt2. ask the submitter to put email address as an optional item
                * opt3. ask the submitter to send their email address to team-wot to start the review procedure
                * opt4. any other ideas?
            * In any case, need to clarify what to be done how as a note explicitly. 
        * [Security and Privacy Categories - #290](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/290) 

**NOTE:**
To avoid potential conflicts and make the discussion easier:
* It would be better to generate PRs on editorial problems and PRs on normative problems separately.
* Also it would be better to raise an Issue and/or a PR separately for each form item one by one.

## Functional Requirements
What kind of functionality is needed to implement the proposed use cases.

**NOTE:** We need to consider:
* Publication schedule, i.e., "September, 2024" as the publication date for the WoT Use Cases and Requirements Note"
    * We'll discuss basic publication schedule during today's call later.
* Relationship with the existing discussion on the "work items" by the other TFs
    * We'll start discussion on Fuctional Requirements during today's call later.

## Technical Requirements
What kind of feature is needed (=to be added or improved) for each WoT specification, i.e., WoT Thing Description and WoT Discovery.
