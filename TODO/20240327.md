## Logistics
Please remember the following:

    * Apr-10 Right after the AC Meeting 2024 in Hiroshima
    * Apr-17 Right after the W3C JP Meeting
* Daylight Saving changes
    * European Summertime starts on March 31.
        * So the start time will be back to the original time (1pm CEST) in Europe after March 31.
        * No change in US/Japan.

## Updated Plan
### Proposed Updated Plan on 13 March 2024

### Propose Updated Plan on 27 March 2024

* Apr-3 and Apr-24: Fix basic Functional Requirements template based on a concrete eample

Any objections/opinions?

**TODO:** We need to consider:
* Publication schedule, i.e., "September, 2024" as the publication date for the WoT Use Cases and Requirements Note"
    * We'll discuss basic publication schedule during today's call later.
* Relationship with the existing discussion on the "work items" by the other TFs
    * We'll start discussion on Fuctional Requirements during today's call later.

## Minutes review and discussion points

### Minutes

[Mar-13 minutes](https://www.w3.org/2024/03/13-wot-uc-minutes.html)

### Discussion points

* Confirmed logistics: Cancellations, Daylight Saving Changes
* Confirmed updated Plan
* Discussed Use Case Template based on [example-template.md](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/USE-CASES/example-template.md)
    1. Mizushima showed the updated Use Case Template which includes all the proposed changes discussed during the previous call on Mar-6 
    2. Discussed further improvement, and put Relationships, Wide Review Considerations and Gaps to the bottom
    3. Agreed to add links of the existing questionnaires to the wide review section
        * [security and privacy review](https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/main/publication/ver11/security_and_privacy.md)
        * [accessibility review](https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/main/publication/ver11/accessibility.md)
        * [internationalization review](https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/main/publication/ver11/internationalization.md)
    4. After adding links to questionnaires, need to discuss how to handle the security categories based on the feedback from the Security TF

Any objections to the minutes and the discussion points above?

## Resolution for the Use Case template

Let's make a resolution for the basic Use Case template!

Based on the discussion points above, the [Use Case template](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/USE-CASES/example-template.md) has been updated as follows:
* Relationships, Wide Review Considerations and Gaps have been moved to the bottom.
* Links to the following three questionnaires on the wide review have been added:
    * [security and privacy review](https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/main/publication/ver11/security_and_privacy.md)
    * [accessibility review](https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/main/publication/ver11/accessibility.md)
    * [internationalization review](https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/main/publication/ver11/internationalization.md)

Now I'd like to suggest we approve the basic Use Case template and start discussion on Functional Requirements (and its categorization).

Can we approve the [basic Use Case Template](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/USE-CASES/example-template.md)?

BTW, now we can safely close Ege's [PR 277 - Separate relationships](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/pull/277).

## Publication Schedule
As [schedule.md](https://github.com/w3c/wot/blob/main/planning/schedule.md) says, we're planning to publish an updated Note for "WoT Use Cases and Requirements" (UCR Nte) in September, 2024.

We, WoT-IG Use Cases TF, should think about how our publication schedule would fit the WoT-WG
 TFs' publication schedule, and how we could provide input to the other TFs as a basis of spec updates in a timely manner.

### Basic policy
Publish an updated Note every 3 months as a basis of spec generation

* Publishing the UCR Note regularly would be useful to keep the "[heatbeat](https://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/groups.html#three-month-rule)" of the WoT-WG/IG's activity, though "heartbeat" itself is not a reuitement.
    * ***NOTE:*** The [latest W3C Process](https://www.w3.org/2023/Process-20231103/#revising-wd) simply mention "If 6 months elapse without significant changes to a specification, a Working Group should publish a revised Working Draft, whose status section should indicate reasons for the lack of change."
* Publishing the latest updates on the temlates for use case description and requirement description would be benefitial to both the use case submitters and the WoT-WG TFs.
* In addition, regular publication of the UCR Note would help WoT-WG TFs see potential updates to their publication schedule. 

### Basic draft schedule:
* April/May:
    * Use Cases TF clarifies use cases and requirements including the potential feedback from the WoT JP CG,
* June:
    * UCR Note publication 1
        * updates on the templates for use cases and requirements
        * provides input to the WoT-WG TFs for spec updates
    * WoT-WG TFs publish updated specs as WoT 2.0 FPWDs
        * Interim updates, e.g., refactroing and basic direction for 2.0 versions
* September: UCR Note publication 2

## Functional Requirements
We need to think about the relationship with the existing discussion on the "work items" by the other TFs.
* We'll start discussion on Fuctional Requirements during today's call later.
