## Minutes review and discussion points

### Minutes

[Apr-24 minutes](https://www.w3.org/2024/04/24-wot-uc-minutes.html)

### Discussion points
* How to let non-IG members submit their use cases?
    * Resolution: use Github Issues to let people including non-Members submimt use cases
    * Proposal from Luca to use YAML to describe the template so that (1) specify which items are required and (2) additional notes on how to describe the items to be automatically included

## Github Issue template using YAML

* Proposal from Luca during the previous call to use YAML to describe the template
    * generated an example template using YAML
        * [MD-based Use Case template](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/USE-CASES/use-case-template-2024.md)
        * [YAML-based Use Case template](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/new?assignees=&labels=UC&projects=&template=subsection-test.yml&title=Add+new+use+case%3A+%3Ctitle%3E)
            * [YAML for that purpose](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/subsection-test.yml)

* Proposal: Use YAML-based template for GitHub Issues to submit a use case
    * YAML has the following nesessary features:
        * all items can be described
        * additional notes from the old template can be described
        * required/optional can be specified

## Functional Requirements
What kind of functionality is needed to implement the proposed use cases.

**NOTE:** We need to consider:
* Publication schedule, i.e., "September, 2024" as the publication date for the WoT Use Cases and Requirements Note"
    * We'll discuss basic publication schedule during today's call later.
* Relationship with the existing discussion on the "work items" by the other TFs
    * We'll start discussion on Fuctional Requirements during today's call later.

## Technical Requirements
What kind of feature is needed (=to be added or improved) for each WoT specification, i.e., WoT Thing Description and WoT Discovery.
