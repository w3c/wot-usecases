## Basic plan about how to proceed
* Today: settle the discussion on the process
* Next week: clarify basic templates, one for use cases and another for requirmeents 
* In 2 weeks: start to think about several concrete use cases and requirements based on the proposed template

## Minutes review and GitHub Issue creation (with "Process" label)
[Jan-31 minutes](https://www.w3.org/2024/01/31-wot-uc-minutes.html)

Topics discussed during the call and possible GitHub Issues:

1. [Proposed workflow](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/HOWTO.md)
* approved, so continue the Use Cases discussion based on the workflow

2. Issues extracted from the discussion during the previous call
* There were seven topics to be recorded during the previous UseCases TF Call.
* Four new Issues were created on GitHub and approved
    * [Issue 263 - How to extract information, e.g., about requirements, from the UC description?](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/263)
    * [Issue 264 - When/which level of UC description to be generated?](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/264)
    * [Issue 265 - Who/how to submit UCs?](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/265)
    * [Issue 267 - How to deal with gap analysis? Need clear definition for "gap analysis"](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/267)

3. Discussion on [Issue 257 - [Discuss] Focus on Functional Requirements](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/257)
* Discussion points on "functional vs technical" during the [Jan-31 call](https://www.w3.org/2024/01/31-wot-uc-minutes.html):
    * McCool: The discussion to have is whether use cases need to be low level or not.
    * Lagally: There is also the discussion on whether we should consider business requirements which are even higher level.
    * Kaz: we should focus on functional level description for Use Cases and Requirements for the Use Cases and Requirements document to describe users' story and need.
    * Ege: I want to stress that we need technical details from the inputs of users. Otherwise they are too high level and cannot be used for feature extraction
    * McCool: we should not overconstrain the requirements that will constrain the specifications.
    * Mizushima: use cases document should be about functional requirements.
    * Kaz: we need multiple levels, (1) functional level description about users' need for use cases and (2) technical level of description for Requirements description.
    * Ege: We need as technical as possible for driving specifications. It is better to separate them from the beginning as toumura-san has proposed.
    * kaz: We should clarify what we mean by "Functional" and "Technical" clearer. We want use case submitters to explain their "User Scenario" (or "User Story") a bit in detail for their use cases. This seems to be something we agreed on. I think what McCool mean by "functional" is that we need user stories first.
    * Cristiano: I kind of support Ege with the bottom-up approach. We have done work on going through issues and they are very actionable. We can write a use case from such issues.
    * Cristiano: Sometimes use cases are mixed with stories. Sometimes they are feature descriptions. So we should clarify the definition first.
    * Koster: I think that the problem is split. Functional requirement is high level, a description of the problem. We should have more requirements without designing the solution. In some cases, the solution can be visible in the requirement since a certain stack might be needed.
    * McCool: It is just about where the work takes place.
    * Kaz: we've clarified the basic workflow, and have started actual discussion based on that. So let's continue the discussion based on the workflow.

Mizushima's suggestions:
* We should continue the discussion about "Functional vs Technical Requirements" using the GitHub Issue 257.
* For that purpose, we need to clarify (a) what we mean by "functional" and "technical" and (b) what we expect for "user stories".
* We should create a separate Issue for [Toumura-san's comment](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/257#issuecomment-1907308039) about the structure/category of the use case description.
* It seems there are some more different points included here, and I'd like to suggest we handle those points separately using threee more different Issues:
    1. What level (technical, functional, business, etc.) to be described for use cases?
    2. What would be the possible items for use case description?
        * Would (1) what to be standardized including use stories, (2) applicabilty of WoT including the benefit of WoT and (3) WoT impleentation feedback be useful?
        * How to describe user scenarios, user stories and/or user needs for use cases?
        * How to extract requirements from the use case description?
    3. How to deal with the feedback from the TFs working on each specification, e.g., possible bottom-up use case proposal based on necessary features?

## Need to clarify the basic structure of the Use Cases and Requirements document
* Based on the discussion so far, I think we need to clarify the basic structure of the Use Cases and Requiements document before diving into the detailed discussion on each Issue.

* How to organize use cases and requirements?
    * It is common we have multiple use cases which lead to one specific reuirement, e.g., security protection or multi-device mashup.
    * On the other hand, one specific use case provides several different requirements.
    * So it would be easier to manage the description if we split the use cases section and the requirements section. Also it would be better to split the use case template from the requirement template.

* Then we can think about which template/section should describe what based on the proposed [Process.md](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/Process.md).

## Discussion on Process.md

* Based on the discussion during the Use Cases calls, we should improve the proposed [Use Cases Process](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/Process.md).
* For that purpose, we should add two kinds of labels to each Issue, (1) "Process" label to identify the Issue is related to the Use Case Process discussion and (2) anothr label to show which phase of Use Case handling the Issue is related to (Use Case Definition, Requirement Extraction, Gap Analysis, etc.) 
* We've got many Issues for "Use Case Definition" and "Requirement Extraction" based on the discussion during the Use Cases calls, so I'd like to talk about the "Gap analysis" quickly.

### Gap Analysis
* Probably it would be better to make "Gap Analysis" part of the "Use Case Definition" phase and the "Requirement Extraction" phase rather than having it as a seprate phase. 
    * When we get a new use case proposal, we should see if there is any similar/identical use case.
        * If there is a similar or an identical use case already, the new proposal should be refused or merged with the existing use case.
    * When we extract a new requirement, we should see if there is any similar/identical requirement. 
        * If there is a similar or an identical requirement already, the new proposal should be refused or merged with the existing requirement.
