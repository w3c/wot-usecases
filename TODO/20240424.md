## Wrap-up "further discussion" on the Use Case Template

### Q1: How to let non-IG members submit their use cases?
* [Issue 281 - Mention Possibility of External Submissions via Issues #281
](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/281)
    * would agree and propose we use [GitHub Issue mechanism](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/new/choose) to submit a Use Case
    * We can embed the Use Case template within GitHub Issues like:
        * [Strategy Issues](https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues)
        * [Transitions Issues](https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues)

### Q2: What to be described by the README?
* Describe the Use Case submission procedure
    * would suggest we start with clarifying the procedure about submitting use cases via the GitHub Issue mechanism
    * [PR #283 - Use GitHub Issues to submit Use Cases](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/pull/283)

### Q3: How to apply existing guidelines within the old template?
* Notes within the [old template](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/USE-CASES/use-case-template.md) to be recorded within the [README.md](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/edit/main/USE-CASES/README.md)
    * included in [PR #283 - Use GitHub Issues to submit Use Cases](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/pull/283)

## Functional Requirements
What kind of functionality is needed to implement the proposed use cases.

**NOTE:** We need to consider:
* Publication schedule, i.e., "September, 2024" as the publication date for the WoT Use Cases and Requirements Note"
    * We'll discuss basic publication schedule during today's call later.
* Relationship with the existing discussion on the "work items" by the other TFs
    * We'll start discussion on Fuctional Requirements during today's call later.

## Technical Requirements
What kind of feature is needed (=to be added or improved) for each WoT specification, i.e., WoT Thing Description and WoT Discovery.

## Basic Publication Schedule
* April/May:
    * Use Cases TF clarifies use cases and requirements including the potential feedback from the WoT JP CG
* June:
    * UCR Note publication 1
        * updates on the templates for use cases and requirements
        * provides input to the WoT-WG TFs for spec updates
    * WoT-WG TFs publish updated specs as WoT 2.0 FPWDs
        * Interim updates, e.g., refactroing and basic direction for 2.0 versions
* September:
    * UCR Note publication 2
