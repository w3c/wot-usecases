    * How to reuse the UC template
        1. The WoT-JP CG would like to copy the WoT Use Case template to their repository.
        1. Then they would like to describe their use cases in Japanese using the template.
        1. And bring the use cases back to the WoT Use Cases TF after translating the use cases in Engish.
        1. The original Japanese use cases should be archived so they are available for future reference.
    * It is nessessary to do a trial run for the UC template right away.
* Fix the YAML-based Use Case template
    * Editorial Issues and PRs

            * There could be possible privacy issue to put the email address on GitHub.
            * Kaz had discuusion with the Security contact from the W3C Team.
                * Basically, getting email address itself is fine if needed.

                    * We ask submitters to send the information separately to the team-wot list
                    * we can add a note about that to the UC template
            * We should have a policy to delete UC proposals if we can't contact the submitters

Any objections to the minutes and the discussion points above?

## Fix the YAML-based Use Case template
* Issues and PRs
    * Editorial Issues and PRs
        * [Change the order of items of sample-usecase-template.yml based Issue … #293](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/pull/293)
            * This PR was created as a result of discussion on ["What to be done?" is ambiguous #287](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/287)
            * But this should be closed because sample-usecase-template.yml is a old file.
            * See alse [Delete old issue templates #294](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/pull/294)
            * After this PR is cloased , new same PR should be created using .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/WoT-UseCases-Template.yml.
        * [Delete old issue templates #294](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/pull/294)
        * [Template Updates #295](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/pull/295)
            * There are some similar files in [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE).
            * So we need to organize them.
            * Then there will only be .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/WoT-UseCases-Template.yml.
            * And there are some fixes.
    * Need discussion
        * How to manage Real names and e-mail addresses
            * previus discussion
                * Eventually need some way to find real names when we publish the UCR Note
                * Dees e-mail address need to be described?
                    * E-mail address is required to contact submitters.
                    * There could be possible privacy issue to put the email address on GitHub.
                    * Kaz had discuusion with the Security contact from the W3C Team.
                        * Basically, getting email address itself is fine if needed.
                        * We need to think about how to manage the information separately.
                            * We ask submitters to send the information separately to the team-wot list
                            * we can add a note about that to the UC template
                    * We should have a policy to delete UC proposals if we can't contact the submitters
            * ["Submitter" should indicate Real Name(s) - #286](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/286)
            * [Form template Updates - PR #285](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/pull/285)
                * mainly problem on how to handle submitter's email address as contact information
                * several possible options:
                    * opt1. no need for email address but simply use the GitHub account to contact the submitter
                    * opt2. ask the submitter to put email address as an optional item
                    * opt3. ask the submitter to send their email address to team-wot to start the review procedure
                    * opt4. any other ideas?
                * In any case, need to clarify what to be done how as a note explicitly. 
        * [Security and Privacy Categories - #290](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/290) 

## Internal Trial
* Ege make a new ssue for the internal trial of Use Cases
    * [Historical Data #296](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/296)
    * See also a Ege's comment of [Template Updates #295](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/pull/295).

## Refactoring
* When will use cases be collected?
    * Current issues
        * Plans to collect use cases are significantly delayed
        * Use cases should be collected as soon as possible.
        * If use cases are delayed to collect, it will affect the writing of WoT WG/IG.
        * Unless YAML-based issue template is fixed, it is hard to discuss functional and technical requirements.
        * To do one trial run ourselves before involving external parties. 
   * Proposal
      * There are three types of submitters.
         * Type1. WoT WG/IG members
            * Type2. People who have been asked to submit Use Case by WoT WG/IG members
            * Type3. Other (i.e. People who WoT WG/IG members don't know)
         * Fix the YAML-based issue template as quickly as possible
            * The complete YAML-based issue template is required for Type3.
            * If they have questions, they can not ask us them easily.
            * we have to create the compleate YAML-based issue templat for them
            * After it is fixed, we start to cllect use cases from Type3.
         * In parallel, we will start collecting use cases from Type1 and Type2 using current template.
            * Question items are fixed.
            * If they have questions, they ask us them easily.
* When will discussions of functional requirements and technical requirements be started?
   * Clarify what functional requirements are and what technical requirements are.
   * Clarify differences between functional requirements and technical requirements.
      * These should be describe in Use Cases and Requirements note.
   * How are a functional requirements template and a technical requirements template described?
      * For discussion, we need drafts of a functional requirements template and a technical requirements template.
* The Structure of Use Cases and Requiremnts note
    * How to use [previos Use Cases and Requiremnts note](https://w3c.github.io/wot-usecases/)
      1. Add new use cases and new requirements into previos Use Cases and Requiremnts note
      1. Refactor using new use cases, new requirements and previos Use Cases and Requiremnts note
      1. create new Use Cases and Requiremnts note without previos Use Cases and Requiremnts note
* Publication Schedules
    * If publicate Use Cases and Requirements note, it needs some use cases at least.


**NOTE:**
To avoid potential conflicts and make the discussion easier:
* It would be better to generate PRs on editorial problems and PRs on normative problems separately.
* Also it would be better to raise an Issue and/or a PR separately for each form item one by one.

## Functional Requirements
What kind of functionality is needed to implement the proposed use cases.

**NOTE:** We need to consider:
* Publication schedule, i.e., "September, 2024" as the publication date for the WoT Use Cases and Requirements Note"
    * We'll discuss basic publication schedule during today's call later.
* Relationship with the existing discussion on the "work items" by the other TFs
    * We'll start discussion on Fuctional Requirements during today's call later.

## Technical Requirements
What kind of feature is needed (=to be added or improved) for each WoT specification, i.e., WoT Thing Description and WoT Discovery.
