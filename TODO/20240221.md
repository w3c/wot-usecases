## Updated plan
The original plan 2 weeks ago was:
* Feb-7: settle the discussion on the process
* Feb-21: clarify basic templates: one for use cases and another for requirments
* Feb-28: start to think about several concrete use cases and requirements based on the proposed template

Given the discussion on Feb-7, would suggest the following updated plan for today:
* Feb-21 (today): Clarify Functional Requirements and Technical Requirements using some specific example(s)
    * As a result, we should be able to get insights on possible templates for the following:
        * Use Cases
        * Functional Requirements
        * Technical Requirements
* Feb-28: Fix basic templates for Use Cases, Functional Requirements and Technical Requirements
* Mar-6: start concrete work on Ues Cases, Functional Requirements and Technical Requirements

Can the updated plan be approved? (Yes/No)

## Minutes review and GitHub Issue creation with "Process" label
### Minutes
[Feb-7 minutes](https://www.w3.org/2024/02/07-wot-uc-minutes.html)

### Discussion points
* [Issue 257 - Focus on Functional Requirements](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/257)
    * We should continue the discussion about "Functional vs Technical Requirements" using the GitHub Issue 257
    * There are 6 more topics to be filed as separate GitHub Issues within this Issue 257.
        1. What we mean by "functional" and "technical"
        2. What we expect for "user stories" from the Use Case description
        3. Tomura-san's proposal on strucure and category of "Use Cases"
        4. What level (technical, functional, business, etc.) to be described for use cases?
        5. What would be the possible items for use case description?
        6. How to deal with the feedback from the TFs working on each specification

* Need to clarify the basic structure of the Use Cases and Requirements document
    * Discussion
        * Mizushima: Sometimes a UC may lead to multiple requirements, so I'd split the UC template from the Requirements template
        * Ege: I agree it should be separated. We have a many to many mapping.
        * McCool: We do already have separate templates (within separate sections) - See [UCR doc](https://w3c.github.io/wot-usecases/#toc)
        * Luca: In general we have many to many map between UC and Requirements, so we should have interlinked documents for both
        * Kaz: The current "WoT Use Cases and Requirements" document already has two separate sections, one for Use Cases and another for Requirements.
            * On the other hand, there is a possibility we have two separate documents, one for Use Cases and another for Requirements.
            * Given that, we might have to think of two levels of requirements: ones for the UC, that are functional, and ones for the specification, that are technical.
            * "Functional Requirements" extracted from the Use Cases should be included in the "WoT Use Cases and Requirments" document, while "Technical Requirements" could be handled by each specification, e.g., WoT Thing Description and WoT Discovery, as the basis of feature definition.
            * We need to clarify what those two levels of Requirements would be.
        * Ege: Some more detailed examples needed to clarify them.
    * Summary
        * Need for sepration between Use Cases and Requirements so that we can describe the many to many mapping between Use Cases and Requirements
        * Need to clarify possible 2 levels of Requirements needed
            * Functional Requirements based on Use Case description
            * Technical Requirements for Feature Definition 
        * Need to clarify them based on concrete example descriptions
 
### Questions
Can the minutes themselves be approved? (Yes/No)

Can the discussion points be approved? (Yes/No)

## Clarification of Functional Requirements and Technical Requirements
### What we need to do
* "Functional Requirements" are extracted from the Use Case descriptions, and to be included in the "WoT Use Cases and Requirements Note".
    * That implies that the Use Case descriptions need enough information for the Use Cases TF to extract "Functional Requirements".
* On the other hand, "Technical Requirements" are generated based on the "Functional Requirements", and could be described within each specifaction by each specification TF, e.g, WoT Thing Description by the TD TF.
    * That implies that the "Functional Requirements" need enough information for the specification TF to generate "Technical Requirements".

Can we agree on the basic definition above?

### Concrete example(s)
Resources:
* [WoT Use Cases and Requirements Note](https://w3c.github.io/wot-usecases/)
    * [2.10 Smart Home](https://w3c.github.io/wot-usecases/#smart-home)
* [Proposed Process.md](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/Process.md)

The results from this discussion should be useful to define the templates for:
* Use Cases
* Functional Requirements
* Techinical Requirements

#### Use Cases
##### Example:
Within a smart home, the user would like to control the air conditioner and the air purifier at once as if the air conditioner had built-in air purifier capability though they're actually two separate physical devices.

##### Question:
How to describe the Use Case?

The current Use Case template has the following items:
* Submitter
* Target Users
* Motivation
* Expected Devices
* Expected Data
* Dependencies
* Description
* Security Considerations
* Privacy Considerations
* Accessibility Considerations
* Internationalization Considerations
* Gaps
* Existing Standards

However, are those enough to extract the "Technical Requirements"?

Also it might be better to move some of the items above to the "Technical Requirements", e.g., considerations on Security, Privacy, Accessibility, Internationalization.

In addition, as already discussed based on the [Proposed Process](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/Process.md), the following should be also considered:
* Potential adopters/applications
* Stakeholders' interest in using WoT (Why WoT?)
* Which one(s) of all the proposed use case descriptions are typical and atomic?
* Categorize duplicated use case descriptions based on the atomic one

#### Functional Requirements

##### Example:
Grouping of multiple physical devices, e.g., an air conditioner and an air purifier, as a virtual device, e.g., an air conditioner including air purifier capability

##### Question:
How to describe the Functional Requirements?

#### Technical Requirements
##### Example:
* WoT Thing Description should handle the air conditioner and the air purifier as if they were a one single device.
* For that purpose, a TD can describe a virtual device, an air conditioner with air purifier capability, and then export it to the Consumer.
* The Consumer can handle the exported virtual air conditioner via that TD.
* The WoT Discovery also needs to let a Consumer discover a virtual device based on that TD.

##### Question:
How to describe the Technical Requirements?
