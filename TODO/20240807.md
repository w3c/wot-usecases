    * [New Use Case Template Proposal #300](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/pull/300)
        * There are several problems with the current Use Cases Temmplate, based on the trial.
        * The new UseCases Template is completely different from the current Use Case Template.
    * The use case template should be concise and easy for submitters to understand.

    * [How to deal with gap analysis? Need clear definition for "gap analysis" #267](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/issues/267)
* To add explanatory text for each question item
    * There are not enough information for each question items for stakeholders to write.
