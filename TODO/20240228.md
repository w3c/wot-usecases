# Agenda for 28 February 2024

## Plan for spec generation and publication
* Feb-28: Fix basic templates for Use Cases, Functional Requirements and Technical Requirements
* Mar-6: start concrete work on Ues Cases, Functional Requirements and Technical Requirements

**NOTE:** We need to think about the publication schedule, i.e., "September, 2024" as the publication date for the WoT Use Cases and Requirements Note"

## Minutes review and discussion point extraction

### Minutes

[Feb-21 minutes](https://www.w3.org/2024/02/21-wot-uc-minutes.html)

### Discussion points

* Updated plan approved
    > * Feb-21 (today): Clarify Functional Requirements and Technical Requirements using some specific example(s)
    > * Feb-28: Fix basic templates for Use Cases, Functional Requirements and Technical Requirements
    > * Mar-6: start concrete work on Ues Cases, Functional Requirements and Technical
* Discussed "Functional Requirements" and "Technical Requirements", and got basic consensus on what to do
    > * Clarification on what to be documented for "Functional Requirements" and "Technical Requirements"
    >    * "Functional Requirements" are extracted from the Use Case descriptions, and to be included in the "WoT Use Cases and Requirements Note".
    >        * That implies that the Use Case descriptions need enough information for the Use Cases TF to extract "Functional Requirements".
    >    * "Technical Requirements" are generated based on the "Functional Requirements", and could be described within each specifaction by each specification TF, e.g, WoT Thing Description by the TD TF.
    >        * That implies that the "Functional Requirements" need enough information for the specification TF to generate "Technical Requirements".
* Started initial discussion based on a concrete example of smart home use case
    * Summary:
        1. We're OK with Mizushimas's proposed direction.
        1. The example on "grouping of devices for smart home" is fine.
        1. However, we still need to improve and clarify how to describe Use Cases, Functional Requirements, and Technical Requirements.
        1. In addition, we need to clarify who/how to extract the requirements.
            * Technical Requirements should be handled by the UC TF collaboratively with the spec TF participants
    > * Opinions from participants: 
    >    * Ege: If the information within the Use Case template enough for requirements extraction
    >        * we generally would like to have knowledge about that here
    >        * Functional Requirements should be provided by the Use Case submitters themselves
    >    * kaz: extracting not only "Technical Requirements" from Use Cases but also "Functional Requirements"
    >        * who/how to extract the requirements?
    >            * collaboration with the use case submitters for functional requirements
    >            * collaboration with the spec TFs for technical requirements
    >        * but those points are for the next step
    >     * McCool: actual analysis to be done to clarify the Technical Requirements. So need to add further details. 
    >        * we should have some criteria to see if the requirements are satisfied

### Questions:
* Can we approve the minutes themselves?
* Can we approve the discussion points above?

## Continue the discussion on Use Cases, Functional Requirements and Technical Requirements based on the example of Smart Home

### Use Cases
"Use Cases" within the "WoT Use Cases and Requirements Note" should describe the need from the users, developers and industry stakeholders about what to be done for their IoT services, and how WoT standards to be applied to make it easier to implement their services.

The Use Case descriptions should include enough information for the Use Cases TF to extract "Functional Requirements" and "Technical Requirements" later.

#### Example Use Case description for review
**NOTE:** Although we've been discussing ECHONET's new proposal on "grouping devices" for a few weeks, there is no concrete use case description at all for that yet. So I'd suggest we use the existing use case of "[2.10.3 Leaving and Coming Home](https://w3c.github.io/wot-usecases/#UC-leaving-and-coming-home-1)" instead to extract "Fuctional Requireents" and "Technical Requirements"easier and smoother.

Use case of "[Leaving and Coming Home](https://w3c.github.io/wot-usecases/#UC-leaving-and-coming-home-1)"

* Submitter
    * ECHONET Consortium
* Target Users
    * device user
    * service provider (Home Management Service Provider)
    * device manufacturer
* Motivation
    * The purpose of this use case is to improve the usability of home appliances for device users by allowing device users to configure the operation modes of all devices at home without configuring those devices one by one when they leave and come home.
* Expected Devices
    * Lighting, Air Conditioner, Security Sensor, Smartphone
* Expected Data
    * The operation modes of lighting, air conditioner and security sensor. Reading and updating those operation modes on demand.
* Dependencies - Affected WoT deliverables and/or work items
    * (empty now)
* Description![Figure: example system structure of smart home](https://w3c.github.io/wot-usecases/images/wot-use-case-echonet.png)
    * Configuration by a device user before starting to use a service
        * A device user logs in the server of a "home management service provider" with which the user has a contract.
        * The user specifies the operation modes of lighting, air conditioner and security sensor for the time when the user is out of home, the time when the user comes home and the time when the specified amount of time has passed after the user comes home.
    * When the device user leaves home
        * The device user accesses the server of a "home management service provider" with a smartphone and notifies the server that the user is going to leave home.
        * The server updates the operation modes of lighting, air conditioner and security sensor according to the configuration specified by the user for the time when the user is out of home.
        * The server reads the operation modes of lighting, air conditioner and security sensor and informs the user's smartphone of those operation modes.
    * When the device user comes home
        * The device user accesses the server of a "home management service provider" with a smartphone and notifies the server that the user will return home soon.
        * The server updates the operation modes of lighting, air conditioner and security sensor according to the configuration specified by the user for the time when the user comes home.
        * The server reads the operation modes of lighting, air conditioner and security sensor and informs the user's smartphone of those operation modes.
        * When the specified amount of time has passed after the user returns home, the server updates the operation modes of lighting, air conditioner and security sensor according to the configuration specified by the user for the time when the specified amount of time has passed after the user comes home.
        * The server reads the operation modes of lighting, air conditioner and security sensor and informs the user's smartphone of those operation modes.
* Security Considerations
    * It is necessary to prevent unauthorized users other than the device user from using the service provided by the home management service provider.
    * It is necessary to disallow home management service providers other than the home management service providers permitted by the device user in advance to control devices at the device user's home.
* Privacy Considerations
    * It is necessary to protect the information on what operations are done on the devices that are controlled or monitored at the device user's home. It is also necessary to protect the information obtained from the devices that are controlled or monitored at the device user's home.
* Accessibility Considerations
    * User interface provided by a smartphone had better consider accessibility.
* Internationalisation (i18n) Considerations
    * User interface provided by a smartphone had better support internationalization.
* Gaps
    * The method for controlling multiple devices in an orchestrated manner is dependent on the implementation of a client application in the current WoT specification. That is a reasonable design choice. However, the orchestrated control of multiple devices needs to be implemented by each client application even if the same control is done by multiple client applications.
* Existing standards
    * ECHONET Lite (https://echonet.jp/spec_v113_lite_en/ ) and ECHONET Lite Web API Guideline (https://echonet.jp/web_api/ in Japanese ).

#### Review of the use case description
Let's review the Smart Home use case (again) based on the following viewpoints discussed during the Use Cases calls so far to see the following:
* What the Use Case template should describe?
    * Does the current Use Case template include enough information to extarct requirements?
* What the Use Case template doesn't need to describe?
    * Should any of the items within the current Use Case template be described by the "Functional Requirement" instead?

##### General questions
* Is the current template enough to describe the Use Case itself?
* Is the current template enough to extract the "Fuctional Requirements"?

##### What to be addded to the Use Case tmplate?
* Potential adopters
    * For example, device vendors, system integrators and private developers
* Potential applications
    * For example, Web application on a smartphone to control devices within a smart home owned by the user.
* Stakeholders' interest in using WoT (Why WoT?)
    * For example, compatibility between their own standard and WoT.

##### What to be removed from the Use Case template?
* Dependency on the WoT specifications
    * Some of the use cases don't describe "Dependencies - Affected WoT deliverables and/or work items", and probably should be clarified as part of the "Technical Requirements". So it can be removed from the Use Case template.

* Wide review considerations (Security, Privacy, Accesssibility, Internationalization)
    * Propbably, it would be better to move the wide review requirements, i.e., Security consideration, Privacy consideration, Accessibility consideration, and Internationalization consideration, to the "Functional Requirements", because they describe what is necessary from those viewpoints.

* Gap analysis at the Use Case level
    * Gaps for Use Cases should be clarifying overlaps and similarities with the the other Use Cases, shouldn't they?
        * We should categorize duplicated use case descriptions based on the atomic use case.
        * For that purpose, probably we should clarify if there is other existing use case description similar/related to the proposed use case.
    * Which one(s) of all the proposed use case descriptions are typical and atomic?

*  Existing standards
    * If there is any existing standard to be mentioned explicitly within the use case description, e.g., ECHONET want to colaborate with us on WoT Thing Description, we should think about the need for new standardization work on our side. For that purpose, we should clarify the following:
        * Should we simply refer to the existing standard?
        * Should we make the WoT standards compatible with the existing standard?
        * Should we add any new features to the WoT standards for that purpose?
    * Otherwise, we should rather describe "Existing standards" within "Funtional Requirements" after we identified what kind of functions are required.

### Functional Requirements
"Functional Requirements" are extracted from the Use Case descriptions, and to be included in the "WoT Use Cases and Requirements Note".

That implies that the Use Case descriptions need enough information for the Use Cases TF to extract "Functional Requirements".

Resource:
* [4.1 Functional Requirements](https://w3c.github.io/wot-usecases/#sec-functional-requirement)

#### Existing topics from the WoT Use Cases and Requirements Note
* Common Princeples
* Thing Funcitonalities
* Search and Discovery
* Description Mechanism
* Description of Attributes
* Description of Functionalities
* Network
* Deployment
* Application
* Legacy Adoption

#### Question:
How to describe the Functional Requirements?

### Technical Requirements
"Technical Requirements" descrines what is required for WoT standards to meet the "Functional Requirements", and are generated based on the "Functional Requirements".

That implies that the "Functional Requirements" need enough information for the Use Cases TF to generate "Technical Requirements" collaboratively with the specification TF participants.

There are two possible options about where to put the "Techinal Requirements":
* Option 1: described within the "WoT Use Cases and Requirements Note"
* Option 2: described within each WoT specifaction generated by each specification TF, e.g, WoT Thing Description by the TD TF

Resources:
* [4.2 Technical Requirements](https://w3c.github.io/wot-usecases/#sec-technical-requirements)

#### Existing topics from the WoT Use Cases and Requirements Note
* Devices
* Applications
* Digital Twins
* Discovery
* Security
* Use Case Categories
* Risks
* Accessibility

#### Question:
How to describe the Technical Requirements?
