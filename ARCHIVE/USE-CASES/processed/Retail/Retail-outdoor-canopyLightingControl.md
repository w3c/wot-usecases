### Category:

Retail

### Class: 

Outdoor Facility Equipment

### Status: 

### Target Users
- device owners (retailers)
- device manufacturer
- gateway manufacturer
- network operator (potentially transparent for WoT use cases)
- identity provider
- directory service operator

### Motivation:

Identifying data and information relative to the devices and systems described within this document can reduce downtime and delays related to customer transactions.   Long lines can lead to customers leaving, diminishing customer service, and lead to lost sale opportunities for new or existing customers.  Additionally, important health and safety regulations can be observed, automated, and managed to ensure quality is consistent and accurate.

There is a lack of visibility for the store operator into equipment problems for maintenance and energy management.  There are safety concerns for the forecourt and store entry locations.  There are customer experience and brand identity issues stemming from safety and aesthetic issues.

Expected outcomes:
- Proactively respond to device issues.
- Provide better insight into energy consumption.
- Keep locations well-lit and safe.

### Expected Devices:

- Lighting monitor.

### Expected Data:

- The status of lights (e.g., on, off, or offline);
- The status of light ballasts, where applicable; and
- The date/time information of status changes (e.g., on/off) and location within the store.

### Dependencies - Affected WoT deliverables and/or work items:

- WoT Thing Description
- WoT Discovery

### Description:

Retailers want to ensure that all the canopy lights are operational and turned on at the correct times of day.  Lighting is important for aesthetics but also for customer and facility safety requirements.  Being able to identify when lighting is out of order, insufficient, or enabled at the wrong times can have energy and safety implications, as well as affect the overall customer experience of the brand.

#### Variants:

### Security Considerations:

Devices subject to replay attacks and DOS attacks.

### Privacy Considerations:

None. The required data is not PII.

### Accessibility Considerations:

None. No direct user (human) interface is affected.

### Internationalisation (i18n) Considerations:

None.  No direct user (internationalized) interface is affected.

### Requirements:

### Gaps:
