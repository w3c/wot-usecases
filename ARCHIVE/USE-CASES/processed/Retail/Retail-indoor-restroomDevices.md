### Category:

Retail

### Class: 

Indoor Facilities and Power Equipment

### Status: 

### Target Users
- device owners (retailers)
- device manufacturer
- gateway manufacturer
- network operator (potentially transparent for WoT use cases)
- identity provider
- directory service operator

### Motivation:

Identifying data and information relative to the devices and systems described within this document can reduce downtime and delays related to customer transactions.   Long lines can lead to customers leaving, diminishing customer service, and lead to lost sale opportunities for new or existing customers.  Additionally, important health and safety regulations can be observed, automated, and managed to ensure quality is consistent and accurate.

There is a lack of visibility to the equipment for maintenance and issue identification.  Restroom issues can go unnoticed and unreported for periods of time.  Restrooms often are a priority for customers, so restroom issues can directly drive away business and customer traffic inside the store.  Restroom service also creates inefficiencies in the store’s labor.   

Expected outcomes:
- Quickly and proactively identifying issues from misuse or faulty devices can avoid health, safety and customer facing problems.
- Timely identification allows onsite personnel to respond, reduce problems, and avoid additional impacts to the store’s operations.
- Proactive efforts at the store level can also improve labor efficiencies by scheduling activities as needed or prior to busy periods.

### Expected Devices:

- Restroom devices.

### Expected Data:
- The toilets are operational and serviceable;
- The status of motion sensors and their frequency of engagement, which is used for preventative maintenance or to address issues (e.g., constant running water);
- The status of sensors for water consumption, such as flush/actuator monitoring;
- The status of bowl water levels and +/- level tolerance for preventative maintenance;
- Paper levels and the status of auto paper dispensers;
- Hand dryer status (i.e., powered on, offline, online); and
- Sink water pressure level and status.
