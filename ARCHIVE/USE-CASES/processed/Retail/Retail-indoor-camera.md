### Category:

Retail

### Class: 

Indoor Facilities and Power Equipment

### Status: 

### Target Users
- device owners (retailers)
- device manufacturer
- gateway manufacturer
- network operator (potentially transparent for WoT use cases)
- identity provider
- directory service operator

### Motivation:

Identifying data and information relative to the devices and systems described within this document can reduce downtime and delays related to customer transactions.   Long lines can lead to customers leaving, diminishing customer service, and lead to lost sale opportunities for new or existing customers.  Additionally, important health and safety regulations can be observed, automated, and managed to ensure quality is consistent and accurate.

Not being able to access cameras remotely is problematic to loss prevention and store security.  It also can make research and investigations more difficult, costly (labor), or even impossible, depending on the scenario.  

Expected outcomes:
- Proactively monitor cameras and schedule service proactively.
- Inform internal stakeholders of potential issues (e.g., loss prevention).
- Use other functioning equipment to remediate potential collection challenges until service is restored.

### Expected Devices:

- Digital camera device.

### Expected Data:
- The positioning of the camera relative to its settings and date/time stamp of any movement;
- Camera status (i.e., power, online, offline) relative to the video recording system;
- Camera status (i.e., power, online, offline) relative to the invoicing system; and
- Details related to the recording frame rate and resolution.

### Dependencies - Affected WoT deliverables and/or work items:

- WoT Thing Description
- WoT Discovery

### Description:

Retailers would like to ensure that loss prevention and security cameras are operational and recording events as expected, which would be required in concert with the objectives of the camera recording system. 

#### Variants:

### Security Considerations:

Devices subject to replay attacks and DOS attacks.

### Privacy Considerations:

Any recording of individuals must be protected as PII.

### Accessibility Considerations:

None. No direct user (human) interface is affected.

### Internationalisation (i18n) Considerations:

None.  No direct user (internationalized) interface is affected.

### Requirements:

### Gaps:
