### Category:

### Class:

- network operator (potentially transparent for WoT use cases)
- identity provider
- directory service operator

### Motivation:

Identifying data and information relative to the devices and systems described within this document can reduce downtime and delays related to customer transactions.   Long lines can lead to customers leaving, diminishing customer service, and lead to lost sale opportunities for new or existing customers.  Additionally, important health and safety regulations can be observed, automated, and managed to ensure quality is consistent and accurate.

There is a lack of visibility to equipment problems for maintenance, as well as safety issues from inoperable E-Stop systems.  There is also a lack of visibility or knowledge of a tripped/faulty E-Stop that can disrupt fuel operations altogether.

Expected outcomes:
- Proactively respond to device issues.
- Respond to safety-related issues quickly and efficiently.
- Return to normal fuel operations when equipment has been triggered accidentally or due to faulty equipment.

### Expected Devices:

- All stop button device for the fueling system.

### Expected Data:

- The button is operational and online;
- An alert for when the button is used or reset to normal operations; and
- The date and time it was used or reset to normal operations. 

### Dependencies - Affected WoT deliverables and/or work items:

- WoT Thing Description
- WoT Discovery
