### Category:

Retail

### Class: 

Indoor Facilities and Power Equipment

### Status: 

### Target Users
- device owners (retailers)
- device manufacturer
- gateway manufacturer
- network operator (potentially transparent for WoT use cases)
- identity provider
- directory service operator

### Motivation:

Identifying data and information relative to the devices and systems described within this document can reduce downtime and delays related to customer transactions.   Long lines can lead to customers leaving, diminishing customer service, and lead to lost sale opportunities for new or existing customers.  Additionally, important health and safety regulations can be observed, automated, and managed to ensure quality is consistent and accurate.

There is a lack of visibility to the equipment for maintenance and issue identification.  Lighting issues impact aesthetics and the customer experience.  It also presents safety concerns for store personnel and customers.  Overuse of lighting, such as in storage rooms, can increase costs unnecessarily.  Energy consumption can impact store efficiencies and costs. 

Expected outcomes:
- Service
- Tracking energy consumption
- Improving interior aesthetics
- Ensuring lighting is appropriate for time of day and areas within the store (both customer and store associate related) for safety reasons

### Expected Devices:

- Lighting Control device.

### Expected Data:
- The status of lights (i.e., on, off, offline);
- The status of light ballasts, where applicable; and
- The date/time information of status changes (e.g., on/off) and the location within the store.

### Dependencies - Affected WoT deliverables and/or work items:
