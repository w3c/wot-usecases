<!--Provide a description of the problem that is solved by the use case and a reason why this use case is important for the users -->
This use case is related to the semantic modeling of trustworthy IoT entities in energy-efficient cultural spaces such as museums. 
  Nowadays, energy-saving issues have awakened the research community's interest due to the more and more increasing global electricity demand. An excessive
use of energy is believed to derive from public and industrial buildings to cover their daily load requirements in the context of the provision of their services.
Thus, the necessity of developing energy-efficient buildings could be proved beneficial. Notably, the improvement of buildings' energy efficiency leads to Building
Energy Management Systems (BEMS). BEMS objectives include but not limited to: 
  a) the continuous management of energy towards energy consumption optimization; 
  b) the optimization of buildings' visiting conditions towards enhancing visitors experience and comfort, 
  c) the optimization of buildings' environmental conditions towards the protection and preservation of artifacts (indirect contribution).  
The application of BEMS in the context of energy-saving at cultural spaces, and especially at the museums' spaces, is an evolving recent research in-
terest. The protection and preservation of artworks and ancient objects isolated in museums, leads to the necessity of continuous monitoring of the environmental
factors and indoor conditions like temperature, humidity and CO2. This monitoring involves Internet of Things (IoT) entities, which may be considered as an
integral part of BEMS, to reduce energy consumption without: a) sacrificing humans' visiting experience and comfort indoor levels, and b) sacrificing artworks'
protection and preservation.
  The aim of the presented use case is to sketch and highlight the following requirements for knowledge representation: 
  a) representing knowledge related to the trustworthy IoT entities that are deployed in a museum i.e., things (e.g, exhibits, spaces), sensors, actuators, people, data, applications; 
  b) dealing with entities' heterogeneity via semantic interoperability and integration, especially for 'smart' museum applications and generated data; 
  c) representing knowledge related to saving energy e.g., lights, air-conditioning; 
  d) representing knowledge related to museum visits and visitors towards enhancing visiting experience while preserving comfort; 
  e) representing knowledge related to environmental conditions towards protecting and preserving museum artwork via continuous monitoring.
  
A selective representative list of scenarios related to such a use case are listed below. Its scenario is classified to one of the abovementioned requirements:
  
Requirement (a) (trustworthy IoT entities representation and management):
 Count all the sculptures of the museum that are related to visits made by trustworthy students (with a trust degree more than 0.8).
 Name all the trustworthy paintings of the museum created by "Picasso" (paintings that were created by Picasso with a trust degree more than 0.9).
Requirement (b) (interoperability and integration):
 If there are more than two visitors in room "UoAMuseumRoomA1" close to (nearby) an exhibit, classify this exhibit as an "interesting exhibit in
room UoAMuseumRoomA1", turn up the light of this exhibit, and lower the light of the remaining exhibits in the room. This scenario is related to objectives (c) and (d) at the same time.
 If the temperature of room "UoAMuseumRoomA1" and room "UoA-MuseumRoomA2" is less than 18 degrees Celsius, and there are visits in progress in these rooms, then activate the heating device in the rooms
that those visits take place, and deactivate other sources of energy in the remaining rooms of the building.
Requirement (c) (energy saving):
 If there are no visitors in room "UoAMuseumRoomA1", then turn the lights off (or all the sources of energy).
 If the museum's internal and external temperature is between 20 and 30 degrees Celsius, then keep the heating and cooling devices off.
Requirement (d) (enhancing visiting experience and comfort):
 When a visitor enters the museum for the first time, send him a message (e.g., SMS or tweet) with the number and types of rooms, the number
and collections of exhibits, and the average duration of a visit per room.
 If a visitor comes out of the museum, then send him a message with the names of the exhibits he liked most based on the observations he made
during his/her visit.
Requirement (e) (environmental conditions):
 If the temperature in room "UoAMuseumRoomA1" is less than 18 degrees Celsius, then activate the heating device (for visitors' comfort).
 If the humidity in room A is more than 55%, then activate the humidifier device (for exhibits protection).
  
In respect to current WoT Things Description, the requirement here is to extend schema in order to represent trust (trustworthy things, trustworthy devices, trustworthy IoT entities in general).

<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>

From users perspective, this use case sketches knowledge required for an ontology-based BEMS to answer queries such as:
  -Which exhibits are located in UoAMuseumRoomA1?
  -How many sensors (all kinds) are hosted by IoTmuseumPlatformLG?
  -Which rooms have been visited by Visitor01?
  -What temperature measurements have been made in UoAMuseumRoomA1 between 09.00 and 17.00 on 07/12/2020?
  -For observations that are made for Painting01 (in UoAMuseumRoomA1) at 09.00 on 15/01/2021, what is its status in terms of its lamp brightness level and nearby visitors?
  
Reasoning with this knowledge, the identification of interesting exhibits and energy-related observations 
(based on sensing visitors' proximity to exhibits and observation of exhibits' lamp brightness level) is realized. 
For instance, if the brightness level of an exhibit's lamp is "medium" and there are more than two visitors near the exhibit, then this observation
is classified as a) an interesting-exhibit observation and b) an observation to high level energy, meaning that the level of energy (light) for the
lamp of the exhibit of this observation must be raised to high. In addition (another example), if the brightness level of the exhibit's lamp is "medium" and less
than two visitors are nearby this, then classify this as an observation to low level energy, meaning that the level of energy (light) for the lamp of the ex-
hibit of this observation must be raised to low. These examples indicate that a change (decrease or increase) to the level of light (energy) of the
observed exhibit must be applied.

<dt>Security Considerations</dt>
<dd>

Due to visitors/visiting and profile data access requirement, as well as access to data related to public/private buildings, security issues must be considered.

Due to visitors/visiting and profile data access requirement, as well as access to data related to public/private buildings, privacy issues must be considered.

</dd>
<dt>Accessibility Considerations</dt>
<dd>

Accessibility must be a concern in the Cultural Spaces domain. Collabration with the W3C Linked Data for Accessbility Community Group is needed.

</dd>
<dt>Internationalisation (i18n) Considerations</dt>

Internationalization must be a concern as the Culture is an international industry. Need to provide multilanguage labels in different languages e.g., English, French, Chinese.

This use case has been driven by the research directions discussed in the following papers:
  
  - Zachila, K., K. Kotis, A. Dimara, S. Ladikou, and C. N. Anagnostopoulos, "Semantic modeling of trustworthy IoT entities in energy-efficient cultural spaces", 17th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations (AIAI 2021), Crete, Springer, 2021
  - Dimara, A., C. N. Anagnostopoulos, K. Kotis, S. Krinidis, and T. Tzovaras, "BEMS in the Era of Internet of Energy: A Review", 17th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations (AIAI 2021), Crete, Springer, 2021.

These directions focus on requirements to represent knowledge in a Smart Cultural space, to support semantic interoperability and trust of heterogeneous IoT entities (things, devices, people, processes, data).
In respect to the WoT Thing Description (WoT TD), the need to represent trust of IoT entities is accentuated.
