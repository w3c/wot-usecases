# Policy for contributing new use cases

## Use Case policy discussion
* Policy for use case collection to be decided, e.g., how to get use cases from which industry how,
and how to extract requirements from those industry-based use cases
* Use Case Requirements - Template - Geolocation PR

## Questions around the Policy and Procedure:
* How do we manage the discussion productively?
* How do we document the new procedure?
* How to we manage the transition to a new procedure?
* Do we keep on merging new use cases in the meantime?
