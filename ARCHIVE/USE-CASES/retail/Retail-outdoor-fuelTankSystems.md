### Category:

Retail

### Class: 

Outdoor Wetstock (Fluids) Management Devices

### Status: 

### Target Users
- device owners (retailers)
- device manufacturer
- gateway manufacturer
- network operator (potentially transparent for WoT use cases)
- identity provider
- directory service operator

### Motivation:

Identifying data and information relative to the devices and systems described within this document can reduce downtime and delays related to customer transactions.   Long lines can lead to customers leaving, diminishing customer service, and lead to lost sale opportunities for new or existing customers.  Additionally, important health and safety regulations can be observed, automated, and managed to ensure quality is consistent and accurate.

There is a lack of visibility to equipment problems for maintenance, leaks, theft, and short deliveries.  Fuel-related information is also related to sales and reconciliation processes that have financial impacts if not validated.  Compliance by regulatory bodies (EPA, W&M) are required to avoid fines and possible store closings.  Additionally, fuel management can improve and automate ordering and delivery services to ensure fuel is properly routed and available at all locations.

Expected outcomes:
- Proactively respond to device issues.
- Manage fuel delivery and consumption for reconciliation and compliance.
- Improve fuel management for maintenance, delivery, and analysis of each storeâ€™s needs. 

### Expected Devices:

- Fuel tank sensor.

### Expected Data:

- The tank sensors are operational and communicating;
- The details and status of active alarms for a tank;
- The grade-to-tank assignment;
- The remaining product that is available in the tank;
- The storage capacity of the tank;
- The percentage of the tank that is set for water or air;
- Notifications of when the tank is below a specific capacity or a configured floor limit value;
- The date and time of the last delivery and volume delivered; and
- The average gallon flow per minute per product/tank.

### Dependencies - Affected WoT deliverables and/or work items:

- WoT Thing Description
- WoT Discovery

### Description:

Retailers want to ensure that the fuel tank system is operational.  Having appropriate and timely access to deliveries, alarms, and potential leaks or theft is important to store compliance, regulation, and profits. 

#### Variants:

### Security Considerations:

Devices subject to replay attacks and DOS attacks.

### Privacy Considerations:

None. The required data is not PII.

### Accessibility Considerations:

None. No direct user (human) interface is affected.

### Internationalisation (i18n) Considerations:

None.  No direct user (internationalized) interface is affected.

### Requirements:

### Gaps:

### Existing standards:
