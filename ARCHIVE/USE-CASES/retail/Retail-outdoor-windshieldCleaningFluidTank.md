### Class: 

Outdoor Wetstock (Fluids) Management Devices

### Status: 

### Target Users
- device owners (retailers)
- device manufacturer
- gateway manufacturer
- network operator (potentially transparent for WoT use cases)
- identity provider
- directory service operator

### Motivation:

Identifying data and information relative to the devices and systems described within this document can reduce downtime and delays related to customer transactions.   Long lines can lead to customers leaving, diminishing customer service, and lead to lost sale opportunities for new or existing customers.  Additionally, important health and safety regulations can be observed, automated, and managed to ensure quality is consistent and accurate.

There is a lack of visibility to the equipment for fluid levels and usage history.  A lack of cleaning fluid can frustrate customers and negatively impact the brand and customer experience.

Expected outcomes:
- Proactively monitor fluid levels and schedule replenishment.
- Monitor usage (or lack thereof) to identify when windshield squeegees are missing or damaged.

### Expected Devices:

- Windshield Cleaning Fluid Dispensing Device.

### Expected Data:

- The status of the windshield device as online and communicating;
- When the fluid level is less than 50% or a predetermined floor limit;
- The status (i.e., date/time) of when the fluid was last used; and
- The date/time of when the fluid tank was last filled.

### Dependencies - Affected WoT deliverables and/or work items:

- WoT Thing Description
- WoT Discovery
