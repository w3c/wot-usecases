### Category:

Retail

### Class: 

Outdoor Facility Equipment

### Status: 

### Target Users
- device owners (retailers)
- device manufacturer
- gateway manufacturer
- network operator (potentially transparent for WoT use cases)
- identity provider
- directory service operator

### Motivation:

Identifying data and information relative to the devices and systems described within this document can reduce downtime and delays related to customer transactions.   Long lines can lead to customers leaving, diminishing customer service, and lead to lost sale opportunities for new or existing customers.  Additionally, important health and safety regulations can be observed, automated, and managed to ensure quality is consistent and accurate.

There is a lack of visibility to equipment problems for maintenance, and an impact to safety concerns or customer needs when the system is not operating.  There are also compliance requirements (ADA) that may be violated due to malfunctioning equipment. 

Expected Outcome:
- Proactively respond to device issues.
- Reliably communicate to customers.
- Support sites who need to ensure they are compliant with regulatory requirements..


### Expected Devices:

- Public address (PA) device, pump intercom devices.

### Expected Data:

- The PA/Intercom System is powered on, online, or offline;
- The status and validation of bidirectional communications;
- The status of operations with each pump/fueling position; and
- The date and time stamp of communication issues by POS or pump number. 

### Dependencies - Affected WoT deliverables and/or work items:

- WoT Thing Description
- WoT Discovery

### Description:

Retailers want to ensure that the outdoor public announcement (PA) system is operational.  Having the ability to communicate with fueling customers is crucial, and it can help alleviate customer confusion and frustration or address safety issues for both the site and customers.  It often is a state or local government requirement, so identifying functional issues also helps address regulatory requirements proactively.

#### Variants:

### Security Considerations:

Devices subject to replay attacks and DOS attacks.

### Privacy Considerations:

None. The required data is not PII.

### Accessibility Considerations:

None. No direct user (human) interface is affected. These interfaces cover device operation, but not direct messaging to humans.

### Internationalisation (i18n) Considerations:

None.  No direct user (internationalized) interface is affected.  These interfaces cover device operation, but not direct messaging to humans.

### Requirements:

### Gaps:

### Existing standards:
