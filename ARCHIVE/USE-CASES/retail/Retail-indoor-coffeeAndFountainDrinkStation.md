Indoor Food Preparation and Food Service Devices

### Status: 

### Target Users
- device owners (retailers)
- device manufacturer
- gateway manufacturer
- network operator (potentially transparent for WoT use cases)
- identity provider
- directory service operator

### Motivation:

Identifying data and information relative to the devices and systems described within this document can reduce downtime and delays related to customer transactions.   Long lines can lead to customers leaving, diminishing customer service, and lead to lost sale opportunities for new or existing customers.  Additionally, important health and safety regulations can be observed, automated, and managed to ensure quality is consistent and accurate.

Not being able to access drink dispensing equipment puts the burden on store personnel to ensure heating/cooling units are operating at safe levels and that inventory stock has been replenished and refilled according to operating procedure.  Store observations may be inaccurate and subjective, resulting in negative health and safety impacts.  

Expected outcomes:
- Proactively monitor the equipment to ensure food safety and quality measures are in place.
- Schedule maintenance and notify store personnel of equipment problems and the need to use remediation efforts for ready-to eat-products.
- Reduce the additional challenges that are placed on the store personnel to ensure the equipment is functioning and the beverages are at the correct quality standards for customers. 


### Expected Devices:

- Coffee and Fountain Drink Station device.

### Expected Data:
- Status of the dispensing stations (i.e., powered on and online);
- Status and history of each stationâ€™s temperature and notifications when they have exited defined operating windows (greater than X but less than Y);
- Status of all dispensers and their functioning status (i.e., on, off, offline);
- Quantity status (i.e., full, empty, percentage levels for products); and
- Date/time history of the device power and calculation of in-service time.
