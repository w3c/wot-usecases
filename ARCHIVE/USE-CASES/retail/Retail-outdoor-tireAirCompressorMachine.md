### Category:

Retail

### Class: 

Outdoor Facility Equipment

### Status: 

### Target Users
- device owners (retailers)
- device manufacturer
- gateway manufacturer
- network operator (potentially transparent for WoT use cases)
- identity provider
- directory service operator

### Motivation:

Identifying data and information relative to the devices and systems described within this document can reduce downtime and delays related to customer transactions.   Long lines can lead to customers leaving, diminishing customer service, and lead to lost sale opportunities for new or existing customers.  Additionally, important health and safety regulations can be observed, automated, and managed to ensure quality is consistent and accurate.

There is a lack of visibility to equipment problems for maintenance and a negative impact to customer facing equipment.  For purchase programs, there is a negative revenue impact when the equipment is inoperable.

Expected outcomes:
- Proactively respond to device issues.
- Reduce impacts to customers and revenue streams by down equipment.
- Fuel Equipment
- Facility Maintenance
- Marketing

### Expected Devices:

- Tire air compressor device, vacuum device.

### Expected Data:

- The type and/or model of device installed;
- Status of the device (i.e., powered on, online or offline);
- The active/operational use time settings, if applicable;
- The transaction dollar/amount for activation;
- The last time the machine was used;
- The average compressor PSI level used by customers;
- Device activity details for time of day for marketing and pricing;
- The maximum and minimum device values and number of times they are exceeded;
- The status of hose or couplings (e.g., loss of pressure/sensed leaks);
- For coin-operated devices, the status of the coin vault; and
- For card payment-operated devices, the status of the reader and its online/offline state.
