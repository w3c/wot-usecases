### Class: 

Indoor Sales-Related Devices

### Status: 

### Target Users
- device owners (retailers)
- device manufacturer
- gateway manufacturer
- network operator (potentially transparent for WoT use cases)
- identity provider
- directory service operator

### Motivation:

Identifying data and information relative to the devices and systems described within this document can reduce downtime and delays related to customer transactions.   Long lines can lead to customers leaving, diminishing customer service, and lead to lost sale opportunities for new or existing customers.  Additionally, important health and safety regulations can be observed, automated, and managed to ensure quality is consistent and accurate.

There is a lack of visibility to the shelf labels for maintenance and issue identification.  Pricing issues impacts the customer experience and can create issues for inventory and store balancing. 

Expected outcomes:
- Proactively monitor menu boards and schedule maintenance.
- Inform store personnel of issues so they can take necessary measures for labor effectiveness and customer service.

### Expected Devices:

- Price display device.

### Expected Data:
- The status of the devices (i.e., powered on, off, offline);
- The status of individual displays as online and available as well as date/time details for when displays were offline/unavailable;
- The date and time of last price change, its status as an increase or decrease, and when it was applied;
- The details related to whether the price update was successful or failed to update, including date and time; and
- Errors statuses reported and malfunction reporting. 

### Dependencies - Affected WoT deliverables and/or work items:

- WoT Thing Description
- WoT Discovery

### Description:

Retailers need to ensure that the digital price sign and shelf labels are all operational.  Displaying the appropriate prices allows for the retail teams to confirm price updates have been performed, pricing is aligned with promotional campaigns, price book information is correct, and pricing is in line with compliance requirements that can have regulatory implications.
