The [coverage.csv](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/USE-CASES/coverage.csv) file is intended to identify specification gaps to drive future standardisation work.

It is the groundwork for new requirements, which will be described in the REQUIREMENTS subdirectory in the corresponding template.
There will be duplicates in the table, this is expected.

The table has some initial contents that can help as examples for some identified gaps.


 All task forces are requested together with the use case author(s) to assess the coverage of use cases by their specification.

Please use the following conventions:

* Use N/A, if the requirement does not affect the deliverable in the column.
* Use the comment column to describe open issues, questions.
* Use "-" if there is no gap with respect to the deliverable in the column. Difference from the `N/A` is that this use case is implementable with the deliverable and is relevant for the deliverable.
* Write the identified gap, e.g. "hint for UI", if there is a gap with that deliverable. In this case, create an issue in the corresponding deliverable. In that issue, make sure to use the name of the use case.
* Do not use "," to separate entries in a single column, use "/" instead.
