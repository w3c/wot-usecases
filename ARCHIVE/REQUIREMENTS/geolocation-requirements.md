{short description of motivation and business justification}

### Requirements:

Geolocation allows Things or their Features of Interest (e.g. what they measure)
to be associated with a physical location, which
may be indoor or outdoor, and may be static or dynamic.
    
#### User Needs:

Users may need locations that are referenced to named locations, such as rooms, landmarks, addresses or other
"semantic" references.  A location may also be indicated on a map, which is a visual representation of its
relationship to other known landmarks.  Often height above ground is more useful than height above sea level.
An absolute latitude/longitude/altitude reference will usually not be the most
convenient format for the user to interpret location information.

Certain applications need additional information in addition to location, such as orientation (useful for AR rendering)
or velocity (useful when tracking a moving vehicle).
This may also include dynamic locations, paths and historical locations.

#### Technical Needs:
  
Location information can be determined in a variety of ways.  The simplest case is that location is 
recorded using a separate measuring device during installation, for example when attaching a fixed sensor to a 
pole.  In other cases a location-determining technology such as GPS might be used to determine a location
relative to an Earth-centric coordinate system.  It is also possible to use only relative location information,
for example distance to some other entity (proximity) can be used to implement geofencing (e.g. to raise
an alert when an entity is too far away from another one).  Such proximity sensors can be approximate, e.g.
using Bluetooth or WiFi signal strength.

Because the technologies vary on how location is determined, it is useful to also indicate the 
accuracy of the measurements and the coordinate systems they are based on (if there is one) and the
units used for measurements e.g. of distances or altitude.
  
#### Security:

In many cases it will be important to ensure that locations are not spoofed.  For example,
if geofencing is being used to prevent theft of an item, spoofing its location to avoid triggering
a geofence violation would allow the item to be moved without an alert.

#### Privacy:

The location of personal devices that are carried by or attached to a person (e.g. phones, watches, etc) can be considered
personal information and should be treated as such.
Some devices are designed entirely for tracking (e.g. AirTags, iBeacons) and should not be used without consent.

#### Accessibility:

As an extension of user needs, location should be conveyed in a format suitable for the user to understand.
For the visually impaired, for example, describing a location verbally relative to landmarks ("On Charles Street,
east of the river, near the clock tower") may be more useful than displaying a map.

 #### Protocol Requirements

 {Write the protocols that are required or usually used in your use case. Write "flexible" if it does not matter.} 

 #### Content Type Requirements

 Data returned by certain types of devices, e.g. GPS sensors, may follow specific data formats.

 #### Platform or Standard Requirements

 {Write the platforms or standards that are required or usually used in your use case. Write "none" if there is none.}

 #### Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms Requirements

 {Write the authentication and authorization mechanisms that are required or usually used in your use case. Write "flexible" if it does not matter, "none" if your use case requires that there is no authentication.}

### Variants
Geolocation use cases may depend upon one or more of the following variants of this requirement:
* Indoor 
   - When geolocation needs to be performed inside a building or other structure.  In this case, rather than or in additional to a numerical coordinate system to identify location, a named room or a feature may be used as a reference (for example, a named room, or a particular numbered HVAC vent, etc.)
* Topology
   - When relationships between locations are useful, for example connections between rooms or HVAC vents.
* Outdoor 
   - When geolocation can be accomplished using a numerical coordinate system relative to the Earth, e.g. using WGS84 latitude, longitude, and altitude.
* Pose
   - When orientation information is needed, either in addition to location or by itself.  This might also be generalized to include other
     information related to but distinct from location, such as velocity or acceleration.
* Dynamic
   - When location needs to be updated frequently, for example when the location of a vehicle needs to be tracked.
* Static
   - When location does not need to be updated frequently, for example for a sensor installed on a pole.
* Geofencing
   - When it needs to be determined if a location is inside a region. An event or notification should be generated when and entity moves into or out of a region.
     Proximity can be used to define a region without knowing its absolute location, although geofencing (as a more general concept) 
     can also be based on regions defined using absolute locations.
* Proximity
   - When only the distance between two entities needs to be known (but not necessarily their absolute location).  This might be used to enable geofencing when
     the region is defined as being within some radius of a particular entity.
* FoI (Feature of Interest)
   - As defined in the W3C SSN standard, an FoI is an entity being sensed or acted upon by a Thing, which may be at a different location than the Thing itself.
     For example, consider a thermal camera pointed at a certain location in a factory.  The sensor reports a temperature at a location (the location of the FoI) 
     distinct from (and perhaps
     quite far away from) the sensor itself.  If we want to act on the measured data, we need to know the location of the FoI.  If we want to physically
     access the sensor (e.g. for maintenance) then we instead need the location of the sensor itself.
