      <h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        The W3C WoT Thing Architecture [[wot-architecture]] defines the
        abstract architecture of Web of Things and illustrates it with various
        system topologies. This section describes
        technical requirements derived from the abstract
        architecture.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Components in the Web of Things and the Web
          of Things Architecture</h3>
        <p>The use cases help to identify basic components
          such as devices and applications, that access and
          control those devices, proxies (i.e., gateways and
          edge devices) that are located between devices.
          An additional component useful in some use cases
          is the directory, which assists with discovery.</p>
        <p>Those components are connected to the internet or
          field networks in offices, factories or other
          facilities. Note that all components involved may be
          connected to a single network in some cases,
          however, in general components can be deployed
          across multiple networks.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Devices</h3>
        <p>
          Access to devices is made using a description of
          their functions and interfaces. This description is
          called <em>Thing Description (TD)</em>. A <em>Thing
            Description</em> includes a general metadata about
          the device, information models representing
          functions, transport protocol description for
          operating on information models, and security
          information.
        </p>
        <p>General metadata contains device identifiers
          (URI), device information such as serial number,
          production date, location and other human readable
          information.</p>
        <p>Information models defines device attributes, and
          represent deviceâ€™s internal settings, control
          functionality and notification functionality.
          Devices that have the same functionality have the
          same information model regardless of the transport
          protocols used.</p>
        <p>Because many systems based on Web of Things
          architecture are crossing system Domains,
          vocabularies and meta data (e.g. ontologies) used in
          information models should be commonly understood by
          involved parties. In addition to REST transports,
          PubSub transports are also supported.</p>
        <p>Security information includes descriptions about
          authentication, authorization and secure
          communications. Devices are required to put TDs
          either inside them or at locations external to the
          devices, and to make TDs accessible so that other
          components can find and access them.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Applications</h3>
        <p>Applications need to be able to generate and use network
          and program interfaces based on metadata (descriptions).</p>
        <p>Applications have to be able to obtain these
          descriptions through the network,
          therefore, need to be able to conduct search
          operations and acquire the necessary descriptions over the
          network.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Digital Twins</h3>
        <p>Digital Twins need to generate program interfaces
          internally based on metadata (descriptions),
          and to represent virtual devices by using those
          program interfaces. A twin has to produce a description for
          the virtual device and make it externally available.</p>
        <p>Identifiers of virtual devices need to be newly
          assigned, therefore, are different from the original
          devices. This makes sure that virtual devices and
          the original devices are clearly recognized as
          separate entities. Transport and security mechanisms
          and settings of the virtual devices can be different
          from original devices if necessary. Virtual devices
          are required to have descriptions provided either directly by
          the twin or to have them available at external
          locations. In either case it is required to make the
          descriptions available so that other components can find and
          use the devices associated with them.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Discovery</h3>
        <p>For TDs of devices and virtual devices to be
          accessible from devices, applications and twins,
          there needs to be a common way to share TDs.
          Directories can serve this requirement by providing
          functionalities to allow devices and twins
          themselves automatically or the users to manually
          register the descriptions.</p>
        <p>Descriptions of the devices and virtual devices
          need to be searchable by external entities.
          Directories have to be able to process search
          operations with search keys such as keywords from
          the general description in the device description or
          information models.</p>

        <p><a href="https://echonet.jp/english/">ECHONET Consortium</a> is an organization that promotes
          Communication protocol "ECHONET Lite" for home appliances and housing facilities,
          which are essential elements of smart homes, to cooperate with each other.<br>
          We are standardizing the ECHONET Lite and promoting the spread of smart homes
          with support for commercialization of devices which support the ECHONET Lite standards
          and cooperation with related industries. We also develop guidelines for ECHONET Lite Web API
          which can be used to access ECHONET Lite devices via a Web server with RESTful Web API.</p>

        <p>At the PlugFest in October 2021, WoT consumers connected to ECHONET Lite Web API devices
          via an intermediary, which translates HTTP message format. We think that it is desirable
          for WoT specification to support transparent interconnection between a WoT consumer and
          non-WoT devices that use HTTP protocol as a transport protocol, including ECHONET Lite Web API devices.
          We hope that WoT WG would investigate a solution for it.</p>

      <p>
        OPC UA [[OPC UA]]  is one of the important automation standards for device communication
        in the factory domain as well as for Industry 4.0 scenarios such as like
        flexible manufacturing.
      </p>
      <p>WoT should support a standardized binding to OPC UA endpoints
        to enable simple application development such as for cross-domain applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such a binding needs an own set of OPC UA specific vocabulary definitions
        which should be developed together with the experts from the OPC Foundation.
      <p>
        This guarantees that the binding is getting accepted within the OPC UA community
        as well as in the WoT community and avoids heterogeneous (project specific)
        definitions and incompatible OPC UA handlings in Thing Descriptions.

      <h2>EdgeX Foundry</h2>
      <p>
        The EdgeX Foundry [EDGEX] is a community-driven project,
        organized under the Linux Foundation, to define
        a reference software architecture for IoT hubs.
        Its goal is to enable interoperability
        by combining a set of key IoT services with a set of interfaces to a variety
        of IoT device protocols and ecosystems.
        There is a reference implementation of the EdgeX architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        The EdgeX Foundry reference architecture provides a set of protocol translation services and exposes
        interfaces to a variety of ecosystems and devices.  However, it currently
        lacks a standard and IoT-appropriate metadata standard to describe the device interfaces
        (and the data models for those interfaces) that it exposes on the network.
        The WoT Thing Description could fulfill this role; otherwise, the EdgeX Foundry
        architecture fits within the general framework of a WoT system.
