# User Story
Simple form for user-story based requirements.  While we have split 
the elements into Who/What/Why, each of these should be written as if they fit
into a sentence template of the following form:

   *As a* Who *I need* What *so I can* Why.

Each slot should be concise â€” no more than a single line.
The "What" can be interpreted as a Technical Requirement,
and the "Why" can be interpreted as a Functional Requirement.

## Submitter

## Who (As a...): Stakeholder

## What (I need...): Capability
