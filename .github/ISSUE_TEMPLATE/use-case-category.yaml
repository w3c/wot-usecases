  a common property.
labels: ["Use Case Category"]
title: "Provide a concise title for your use case category.  This will be used as the issue title."

        > [!Note]
        Thank you for proposing a new use case category!
        Use case category proposals use a structured GitHub issue so that we can semi-automate the process.
        Use case categories are sets of use cases that share some common property, which allows
        use cases with requirements in common to be grouped.  Use cases can belong to more than
        one category, but are not required to belong to any.
        See the document for examples.
        A bot will check the suggestion after creation, and report on missing properties or other problems
        before we review the suggestion.

        Please enter a compact version of the title, consisting of three or four words at most,
        that can be used as a section header.  This will also be converted into a section id.
        It should not be duplicate of an existing id or section header.

        Define the property that the set of use cases in the category have in common.
        This property is to be used to motivate one or more requirements that use cases in the
        category also have in common.

        List one or more use cases that hold the property defining the category.
        Use cases should be referenced by links.  If a Use Case has not yet been
        merged into the document it is permissible to link to an issue proposing
        a new Use Case.
        If the property applies to all Use Cases (is a universal goal)
        then "All" may be used here.
