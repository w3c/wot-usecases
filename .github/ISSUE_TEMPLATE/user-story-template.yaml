        > [!Note]
        Thank you for proposing a new user story to capture high-level requirements for WoT features!
        User story proposals use a structured GitHub issue so that we can semi-automate the process.
        User stories follow the format of "As a (WHO), I need (WHAT) so that I can (WHY)", but we will prompt
        for each of WHO, WHAT, and WHY separately.   See the document for examples.
        A bot will check the suggestion after creation, and report on missing properties or other problems
        before we review the suggestion.

        The stakeholder who would benefit from or needs the feature.
        This may be an organization, such as an SDO, or a user role, such as a system owner or TD developer.
        The stakeholder and the submitter may be distinct or the same.

          or a link (if an organization, such as an SDO).

      description: |
        What is the desired capability, capacity, or feature?  Provide a short
        summary suitable for inclusion in a user story sentence.  This should be a single
        noun phrase.  If multiple, distinct capabilities are needed to satisfy a single
        purpose consider proposing multiple user stories.

    attributes:
      label: Capability Details
      description: |
         Link to existing features (e.g. sets of assertions) in published WoT standards if the
         capability already exists (if you are documenting the requirements for an existing feature)
         or link to an issue or MD file describing the technical details for a feature if the
         feature does not yet exist but is to be proposed.
